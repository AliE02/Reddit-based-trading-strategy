        "text": "That is, 24 percent of Microstrategy's floating stock is shorted. This sets up well for a squeeze. Bitcoin is currently surging, mainly due to the news that Coinbase has been absolved of it's [SEC lawsuit.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-cleared-in-lawsuit-over-crypto-transactions) Add to that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* BTC halving will occur sometime in the next two weeks, potentially driving up the price of BTC substantially in the short term. MSTR's book value is inherently tied to the cost of BTC, due to Micheal Saylor buying shitton's of coins to put in the companies treasury over the last two years. Over 92% of all the BTC that will ever be mined has already been mined, making it a scarce asset, about to become more scarce.\n* On friday, MSTR faced one of the largest pullbacks in the stock's history, making the price a discount to where it was trading previously.\n* Microstrategy's biggest day(+33%) came on a monday in which BTC had pumped the Sunday before hand and into Monday\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, if futures a solid green tonight, and BTC stays above 69k into the morning, MSTR could see signifanct buying volume in the morning. If it gets large enough, it could force shortsellers to buy back their position, at which point a squeeze cycle would begin. On MSTR's best day, the stock price saw a gain of 21%, or $333 per share.  \n\n\nObviously, we dont know what will happen. Microstrategy has been trending down for the last week, and could continue to. I'm just saying the possibility is there, and this may be one to keep an eye on, at  least in the shortterm.",

        "text": "Due to my unextensive research I believe that RIVN is going to absolutely print in the long run. After IPO, the stock immediatly tanked, with most investors believing that the stock was overvalued. Common reasons for this were that the company is still largely in the investment stage, and despite having a product in the hands of consumers, is still not profitable. With a net income of -5.4b in 2023, the company definetly still has a long way to go, no doubt about it, and most investors rightfully decided to leave the stock alone.  \n\n\nThat being said, the value of the company should not be determined by its current value, but by its potential. It is an \"investment\" after all. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, a new line of vehicles, and EVs taking over, this sentiment will surely change. Most people acknowledge that Rivian will almost certainly take a huge market share in the future, but because that is such a distant prospect, and because the stock's lifetime graph is so pathetic, I beleive that Rivian's price is not only the lowest it will probably ever be (not specifically *now,* but in general. I don't see it ever sitting in the tens after 2030), but that Rivian's potential to breach its IPO within the next few years is not priced in at all.  \n\n\nIn short, Rivian's stock value and options pricing are a response to aggressive short term trading and panic, and not indicitive of long term investment. This is the dip.  \n\n\nIt would be absolutely unrealistic to assume that RIVN will breach it's IPO price within the next 2 years, but it will very likely double as R2 and R3 roll out. 5-8 years I am very optimistically bullish. and believe that it can break it's IPO. Deep ITM and OTM 2yr LEAPS can't go tits up, and the OTM LEAPS can always be rolled into new OTM LEAPS every 6 months to avoid theta decay.",

February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.\n\nYou can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.\n\nI am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.\n\nShould CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.\n\nEDIT: currency is New Taiwan Dollars, didn't feel like converting, sns\n\nEDIT: delete my own stupidity, some initial confusion I had about the data but am now sure of\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gethwgcrzxsc1.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=80ea3c584bb3506dbd04a1822db552fc2ff21d7b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnwopn5s44tc1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3653676d0979943fe5ab72193326fc3f7bcbeeab",

By transforming traditional  candlestick patterns into distinctive phallic shapes, the PFI provides a  unique and intuitive visual representation of bullish and bearish  trends, offering unparalleled insights into market dynamics.\n\nThe core principle of the PFI is its ability to identify and categorize  market conditions into two primary formations: the 'Bullish Shaft' and  the 'Bearish Shaft.' The Bullish Shaft formation signifies strong upward  momentum and investor confidence, typically indicating a potential  buying opportunity. Conversely, the Bearish Shaft formation signals  downward pressure and growing investor pessimism, suggesting a possible  selling or shorting opportunity.\n\nInstitutions employing the PFI in their analysis benefit from its  simplicity and effectiveness. The clear and unmistakable shapes allow  for rapid assessment of market conditions, enabling traders and analysts  to make swift and informed decisions. Moreover, the PFI integrates  seamlessly with other technical indicators and analysis techniques,  enhancing its reliability and predictive power.\n\nThe Phallic Formation Indicator has gained widespread adoption among  hedge funds, investment banks, and asset management firms, who value its  innovative approach to market analysis. Its ability to cut through  market noise and provide clear, actionable signals has made it an  indispensable tool in the arsenal of institutional traders and analysts  worldwide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/script/5VvPvWvC-Phallic-Formation-Indicator/](https://www.tradingview.com/script/5VvPvWvC-Phallic-Formation-Indicator/)",

        "text": "It's very common for people to call day traders \"gamblers\", to conflate the world of trading FDs and small caps with the world of slot machines and rigged table games. \n\nIt only reinforces this view when a trader treats the market like a casino. For instance, the odds of winning any given hand of blackjack are approximately 49% at most casinos (depending on the rules, how many decks of cards, or whether you can speak an exotic foreign language to the dealer). \n\nSo, if walking into a casino with the goal of making a bet with your money and walk out richer a gambler wants to make a single bet, place all the money they brought to gamble with them on one hand BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE LESS THAN 50%. The more hands a gambler plays, the more likely they are to walk out with financial losses (bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49... = CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE DRUNK AS SHIT AND YOUR MONEY IS ALL GONE!). \n\nThe stock market game can be different. There are simple systems of trading and various setups in technicals that can give the trader an edge GREATER THAN 50%, therefore a successful trader will play to stay in the game and make as many bets on setups that give them the odds as possible. So, instead of opening Robinhood and posting all of one's money on a single bet, it makes more sense to let one's self budget for the expense of losing trades. \n\nSay a strategy gives 7 wins for 3 losses on average (arbitrary), then on one's balance they could say they'll risk no more than 5% on any given trade (again, arbitrary and erring towards aggression because we tend to try to get rich quick here). A trader would likely never have such excessive drawdown in their account that they'd be out of the game, and moreso as the percent of risk per their account shrinks. \n\nFor instance, I've noticed if the market opens at support or resistance it will usually be really good odds to buy a call or put for the corresponding scenario, especially because the opening tends to come with a burst of volume and momentum, which can give strong odds for profits on 0dtes >50% within minutes. \n\nSometimes the market doesn't open at support or resistance. What then? Well, the pre-market often can give a trader a few clues on what levels the market may gravitate towards that day. Say the market opens and it does its thing, usually a little tug-a-war, then one side gains the upper hand and there's a burst in price in either direction. A trader can often hop into this momentum and target a pre-market high or low. \n\nWhat about when a stock reaches its resistance or support? Should a trader immediately reverse course and buy a put or call? Not necessarily. Most often there is a battle at these levels that can result in a stock trading sideways for awhile. It would grind away theta on 0dtes and weeklies quickly, and even worse, totally smash their value if the price were to break out and run again the trade. So it's best to wait for something that gives odds like a decisive move past the level (usually including a retest of the level then a move past the prior breaking move), or a double bottom/top (preferably with false break suggesting a large player seeking liquidity at levels with lots of open orders).\n\nOf course none of the three aforementioned strategies have a 100% success rate. Market bots are designed to beat retail traders by tricking them and playing on their emotional tendencies. They're very good at it. So a successful trader has to be nimble minded and prepared for anything. \n\nJust a few thoughts and some of my favorite setups. If you disagree and believe it's best to throw down every bit of money you can access on a single play, I find nothing particularly wrong with that. I find it ballsy and entertaining. \n\nTrading in a systemic and analytic manner is much tougher to execute and few people actually succeed. Those who do usually lose a lot of money before gaining the skillset required to be consistent. I still have a lot of improving to do personally but I do believe I can do it because some other people can and I've had several month long streaks of success. \n\nIt's just a matter of a single day or two where I become emotional after a loss that balloons to the size of Texas (relative to my account) that has kept me from being able to quit my job. I've adopted a strategy of withdrawing gains from my cash account and keeping the balance only large enough to make decent income, but small enough that I likely won't get emotional about it and that any horrible day won't have me begging on a street corner. \n\nAnyways, to those who read this far -- toodles! And good luck! 👍 Share your personal favorite strategy/setup that works best for you if you will. ",

        "title": "RH and BLK and coming earnings and why I shorted RH ?! What about BLK?",
        "text": "Let's see if I can summarize this here. I have been short on RH for some time now. Before making my conclusions, I examined the following data. First off, I want to say that my research led me to believe that the product's quality is not that great. I live in NYC, and RH has an outlet here in Industry City, which is in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their prices are overextended, which I attribute to RH's thorough research. They know that the average household income of families residing in the surrounding areas exceeds $250k per year. I am pretty sure their outlets are in similar locations for the exact same reason: it's a simple profit/loss ratio, and RH knows that the higher profit margin will offset the higher average carrying expenses. So, why would I short the stock and bet against RH? My first reason was the low home sales. Interest rates have risen quite a bit; a 30-year fixed rate is above 7%, and most homebuyers would try to maximize their savings by purchasing furniture from one of RH's competitors. RH supposedly manufactures their furniture pieces in China. Full disclosure, I have no idea where exactly it is made, but a simple Google search will tell you that. Follow this link for more information: \\[link to furniture manufacturing details\\].\n\nHave consumers been complaining about the product or the quality of the product? You can read the reviews for yourself here: \\[link to consumer reviews\\].\n\nNow, my reasoning was that since home sales have been down, and the quality of the furniture is not pleasing to the average consumer, and in general, people are not furnishing their new houses, RH would likely miss their analysts' earnings call and underperform. Well, this is exactly what happened. The adjusted net revenue of $738 million missed the consensus mark of $777 million by 5% and fell by 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue decline was attributed to \"several weather\" events in January and shipping delays related to the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. RH missed Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. RH reported quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, missing the estimated earnings of $1.71 per share.\n\nLogically, one would expect that the price per share of the stock would drop accordingly to account for the revenue loss. However, we witnessed the opposite; the price per share went up by almost 18% after the earnings announcement.\n\nLet's not forget that the short interest before the earnings call was more than 51%.\n\nAccording to the data and common sense consensus, everyone should have expected that since RH did not meet expectations, the price per share would come down to adjust the value based on performance. This did not happen. On the contrary, the price went up, and shorts got squeezed.\n\nCould this be manipulation? No way, this is a fair commodity, a self-regulated market, and manipulations are not possible.\n\nNow, let's talk about the biggest institutional investors behind RH. It turns out that the largest shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.\n\nI am trying to find any correlation between the price movement of RH's stock and BLK's, but my indicators are not refined enough to discover the precise connection, and I would leave this to the readers.\n\nAnyway, why am I talking about RH and a potential connection with market movement and the price of BLK's stock? Well, BLK is set to announce earnings this coming Friday, April 12th.\n\nSo, some scenarios could possibly aid the retail investor's decision. How overstretched are the big funds, and could they go down because their investment assets have come down in price? Let's not forget LULU... What are your bets? Are you playing calls or puts on BLK?\n\nA $10 TRILLION ASSET UNDER MANAGEMENT COMPANY. Can Goliath lose against David?\n\n",

I'm here to tell you that even after this insane run up, its still not too late to get on this ride.\n\nDespite bearish sentiment since their recent earnings, the stock's performance is backed up with improving fundamentals. If the business improves, its stock price will improve. It's strange to see cases where it doesn't happen over time.\n\nI'll go through most of the important information from their financial statements:\n\n**Revenue TTM:** from 3.7b to 4.28b\n\n**ROA TTM:** from 0.1 to 11.54\n\n**ROIC TTM:** from 0.16 to 18.18\n\n**ROE TTM:** from 0.37 to 37.93\n\n**Gross Margin TTM:** from 52.97 to 59.67\n\n**Operating Margin TTM:** from 2.44 to 11.23\n\n**Net Margin TTM:** from 0.08 to 7.67\n\n**Debt to Equity ratio TTM:** from 1.76 to 1.01\n\n**Total assets:** from 2.71b to 2.94b\n\n**Total liabilities:** from 2.01b to 1.92b\n\n**Total debt:** from 1.22b to 1.05\n\n**Net debt:** from 706.59m to 147.48m\n\nThe only thing that was somewhat negative was that EPS was beaten only by 5%, the smallest out of the last 4 quarters.\n\nI think its also important to mention a crucial element of this stock and that is the reduction of 30% of their float. Over the course of the last 6 years, the float was reduced from 65m outstanding to 49m outstanding, yet the price movement didn't respond accordingly. Only once the business made a turnaround, the price finally started it's ascend. In fact, the float was increased in the current year from 49m to 51m.\n\nAlmost every single aspect of the company and financial health improved in the recent quarter, yet the market decided that because the EPS was beaten by just 5%, it means its the end of world.\n\nWill we see the same returns over the coming year? probably not\n\nBut I think this is a case of the \"stock is up this much, its can't possibly go any higher\" fallacy\n\nI'm long on this position, but im guessing around 50-60% upside in the near future\n\nThat's is all for now fellow regards!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cc8z2vugqqsc1.png?width=1313&format=png&auto=webp&s=a422c1df9ebe217ff6156164bbd5c558d72ee3db",

In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What the Hell is PECO?**\n\n**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, \"is one of the nation’s largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO’s centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time.\" **I copy and pasted all of this.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK, Tell me More**\n\n**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**\n\n[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Hypothesis**\n\nI think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. ",

I have a portfolio worth about 175k but I recently lost 15k in United Healthcare ($UNH) stock (this was my largest holding). Since I feel much behind peers in terms of earnings (I only make 65k while many of my friends in finance tech etc. make double or triple that and already have portfolios or houses worth 750k+), I have been trying to be very aggressive, putting most of my money in four or five stocks at a time. On Monday, I had 120k in $UNH. No options though just equities. \n\n So far this year, it has worked fairly well as I have made about 25-30k which is half my salary in capital gains. However, after losing the 15k in UNH, I have been making even riskier moves to chase my losses. I lost another 5k after Monday’s 15k loss. Now I’m thinking about taking a market reset for 90 days and just leaving all of my money in a 5% money market. I want to make the money back to catch up to peers, but I am worried that I’ll just end up losing more. Right now I really want to buy a UNH out for their earnings call but with my luck the stock will end up going up and I’ll lose another 5k.\n\nIt’s even been affecting my personal life as I feel like I’m consumed by the 15k loss. \n\n\nTldr: how to avoid chasing market losses.

The trial plans to enroll approximately 30 people, but will enroll as few as 16 people based on the company's history. \n\nThe drug they are proposing is a variant of Daratumumab, with delivery of the drug to the site of the tumor using special nano technology developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \n\nOne thing I noticed was that the exclusion criteria for the trial included '>40% lymphoma bone marrow involvement'. However, over 80% of small lymphocyte lymphoma cases involve bone marrow, especially with the younger age group (18-34 years) that the company will likely recruit from. \n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889858809000902](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889858809000902)\n\n  \nOf those 80%, more than half will have higher than 40% bone marrow involvement. Even though the 5-year survival period for the most aggressive cases of lymphoma is 60%, this trial will likely fail. This is because the exclusion criteria also mentions that a person cannot be on any maintenance treatment for at least 100 days prior to entering the trial. As a result, a person with recurrent, aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma without maintenance treatment will be poorly equipped to fight the disease. \n\n  \nYmab Therapeutics is running the bulk of it trials in Scottsdale Arizona, where numerous patients have reported their disease initially looking very similar to multiple myeloma, requiring multiple biopsies to confirm the correct disease. Multiple biopsies create the risk of a tumor spreading and becoming untreatable, even if the patient barely satisfies the trial's inclusion criteria. \n\nI believe that the trials will fail to demonstrate any meaningful improvement in the patient's condition despite the company's claim of the drug offering a low toxicity profile. \n\n  \nIf the company does not update its recruiting status by end of April, they are very likely not going to move forward with the trial based on initial results with treated patients. \n\n\n\n",

New regulations intended to prevent bank failures\n3. The value of their assets is overstated because they are not liquid\n\nHere is data corresponding to each of these reports directly from their own 10-K:\n\n  \nThey lost 30% of their allowances for credit losses. \"Our allowance for credit losses coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 1,044.69% and 1,409.16% at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\"\n\nOn competition:\n\n\"The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.\"\n\n... What a crazy thing to report as a bank ...\n\nRegulation\n\n\"Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets, and the determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Additional regulatory focus on the financial services industry is common in connection with an economic downturn, as the industry experienced following the most recent financial crisis. As a result, the adverse effects on our business relating to a future economic downturn could be exacerbated by additional regulations and regulatory scrutiny that accompanied or followed any such downturn. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.\"\n\n... That makes sense but oh well, not risking my savings. Well, I kinda am cuz I moved it to naked puts ...\n\nThem a bank and don't have money\n\n\"We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\"\n\nI don't want to start a panic.

The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.\n\n**Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies. \n\n**Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.\n\n* The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google’s ad business.\n* The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.\n\nTo make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer. \n\nUnder the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.\n\n**Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December\n\nGotta give credit, the full article is [from here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)",

        "text": "It begins as a \"tool\", an artificial intelligence marketed as an innovative solution designed to make your job easier, less stressful, less time consuming. Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.\n\nConsider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?\n\nThe death of Hollywood as we know it.\n\nConsider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the \"list of movies you might enjoy\" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.\n\nImagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.\n\nThe Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.\n\nSo where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The \"largest\" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.\n\nPeople laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.\n\nFor a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?\n\nYou'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.\n\nPositions - NVDA $1,200c January 17th 2025.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Stock prices automatically adjust downward for both regular and special dividends on the dividend ex-date.\n\n2. Option strike prices will get adjusted for special dividends.\n\n3. The company pays out the dividend to ALL holders when a dividend is issued. That means if you are short a stock at $25, if the company pays out a $5 dividend, you, as the short-seller pay the $5 to the person you borrowed the share from (NOT to the company, as the idiot OP in that post seems to think). The company earns NO profit from issuing a special dividend, and it is always a cash outflow for the company. The short pays $5 for the borrowed stock dividend, the stock price gets adjusted from $25 to $20, and you're net even. YOU TOOK MONEY OUT OF ONE POCKET AND PUT IT INTO THE OTHER.\n\nOther caveats that you regards don't seem to understand:\n\n1. Dividends are double-taxed, meaning the company paid taxes on that income, and then you are paying taxes on the dividend.\n\n2. By issuing a dividend, the company is essentially saying \"this fucking clueless regard on WSB knows what to do with the cash better than we do. We will trust them to manage the cash for us.\"\n\nDo you really want to invest in a company who thinks the average fucking room-temperature IQ regard on this sub has better cash-deployment skills than the company's management? If they didn't pay out the dividend, it goes to retained earnings, which can be used to fund growth, make acquisitions, improve operations, etc. Instead, they are trusting fucking /u/suckonyourmomstits to make better use of the cash than they could themselves.\n\nThis isn't an anti-dividend post; dividend-paying companies **can** have their uses in specific portfolio construction cases, however, it seems that the vast majority of regards on this sub completely misunderstand how dividends actually work.",

That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c\n\nLet's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51\n\nHere we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.\n\nFrom the 10-Q:\n\n***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (“QoQ”).***\n\nSoooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?\n\nLater from the 10-Q:\n\n***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***\n\nSo they have three major holdings:\n\n* Aurora Innovations\n* Didi\n* Grab\n\nThey say they \"earned\" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.\n\nSo how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8\n\nSo if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.\n\nLet's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb\n\nThis one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!\n\nSimilarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.\n\nFinally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.\n\nOkay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:\n\n* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)\n* Didi ($414 million gain)\n* Grab ($91 million loss)\n\nIt seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.\n\nBut that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?\n\nWell, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a\n\nFirst up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874\n\nNext up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.\n\nNow for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4\n\nWow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!\n\nSo let's tally up the damage here:\n\n* Grab: $123 million loss\n* Didi: $69 million loss\n* Aurora: $505 million loss\n\nSo in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.\n\nTL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.\n\nAs an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?\n\n**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.\n\nLikely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.\n\n**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said “it will go to $100 because they’re offering a lot of options in the app.” There is no rationale behind these movements. It’s been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch.",

The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.\n\nTo make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer. Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it **difficult** to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.\n\nIs there a potential long-term play for HubSpot?",

        "text": "Abstract:\n\nShort SkyWest Regional Airlines ($SKYW)\n\nSkyWest stock has been on a tear for the past year, almost entirely because they used a decent amount of cash on their books to buy back an extremely large amount of shares in an unprecedented stock buyback. This stock buyback program will soon end, and SKYW stock will drop by \\~50%.\n\nDetails:\n\nSKYW announced in Winter 2022 that they were going to buy back $381 million worth of stock. However, at the time, the market cap. of SKYW was only \\~$800 million, i.e. their buyback program was equal to almost 50% of their market cap and in the beginning, they were buying 10% of all shares traded for any given day. For comparison, this would be as if Apple announced a $1.3 trillion share buyback program. and was buying billions of dollars of shares a day. As such, this unprecedented buyback program sent the stock skyrocketing, far above a fair price, with a PE ratio of 80, for a non-growing airline, while other airlines have been roughly flat during this period (see the ETF $JETS)\n\n  \nHowever, that share buyback program is almost over. Considering that SKYW is now at an all time high, with oil prices as high as they are, once their buying pressure ceases in the near future I expect SKYW to drop such that it's overall performance over this time period will have mirrored other airlines, i.e. the share price will go back to the $20-$30 range compared to its current price of $70.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnnupdy7yosc1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=72bb547e238e128e9d92666eb151a3fbb633c8fe\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj3y49vrzosc1.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bddd7b5c7738c6bf0517fe37f00c7919e6a7475\n\n[https://inc.skywest.com/assets/Uploads/PressReleases/SKYW-Q4-2023-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf](https://inc.skywest.com/assets/Uploads/PressReleases/SKYW-Q4-2023-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf)",

        "text": "You’re probably wondering why I’ve gathered you all here today. \n\nCCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B\n\nAround 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.\n\nIn 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.\n\nCCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. \n\nRCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. \n\n\n\n-CON-\nCCL’s long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. \n\n-HOWEVER-\n\nDuring last quarter CCL’s operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. \n\nCCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, “Our responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders”\n\nI’m confident there’s money to be made here.

It continued much lower and then randomly gapped up 8 bucks a little later so I don't really fault myself at all for not getting every inch of gains cuz greed is obviously punished often with options trading. \n\nThe goal is to just keep grinding up and build the account by limiting losses and ending the day when I'm up 100 or 200 and I don't see obvious opportunities anymore.

Oil prices are going higher, much higher mainly because of the middle east conflict and Russian cutting output. Ukraine is also attacking Russia's refineries putting them out of service. My thought is oil prices will get to $100+ if Iran retaliates and Saudi's don't boost production to make up the difference. Also the Strategic Petroleum reserves are being used and not refilled, we may reach a point when reserves get super low. This is good for US oil companies though.\n2. There is economic incentives for EV's none for ICE. People who buy new electric vehicles may be eligible for a tax credit as high as $7,500, and used electric car buyers may qualify for up to $4,000. California residents get extra incentives. We are in a election year, we may see more incentives if oil gets out of control.\n3. last month Biden issued an executive order to speed up the elimination of ICE cars and push for more EV adoption.

This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.\n\nYTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b\n\nHowever, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):\n\n\\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  \n\\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).\n\n***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***\n\nA quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.\n\n**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**\n\nI've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE—an affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.\n\nIt's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.\n\nPulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.\n\n*Top 10 electric motorcycle sales in 2023 (Taiwan)*\n\nRanking | car model | sales volume | Market share (%)  \n1| Gogoro Viva Mix | 16422 | 20.6  \n2| Gogoro Viva | 9994 | 12.6  \n3| Gogoro Delight | 9358 | 11.8  \n4| Gogoro Viva XL | 7322 | 9.2  \n5| Gogoro SuperSport | 6810 | 8.6  \n6| Gogoro Premium/2 Series | 6322 | 7.9  \n7| Ionex i-One Air | 4180 | 5.3  \n8| Ionex i-One Fly | 3274 | 4.1  \n9| Aeonmotor Ai-1 Sport | 2032 | 2.6  \n10| Ionex i-One | 1594 | 2\n\n**International Recognition**\n\nMarch 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific’s #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.\n\nFast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring. \n\n[https://www.gogoro.com/news/fast-company-2024/](https://www.gogoro.com/news/fast-company-2024/)\n\n**Gogoro Partner News**\n\nMarch 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies – an incredible accomplishment!\n\nWith Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.\n\n[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)\n\nApril 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. \n\n \"On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.\"\n\n[https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/ev-led-delivery-service-firm-zypp-electric-posts-3x-revenue-growth-in-fy24-124040300979\\_1.html](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/ev-led-delivery-service-firm-zypp-electric-posts-3x-revenue-growth-in-fy24-124040300979_1.html)\n\n**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**\n\n\\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  \n\\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  \n\\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  \n\\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.\n\n**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**\n\n\\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  \n\\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  \n\\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  \n\\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  \n\\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).\n\n**Battery Swapping Network**\n\n\\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  \n\\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  \n\\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  \n\\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  \n\\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.\n\n**Share Price**\n\n\\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).  \n\n\nSource of scooter sales data:  \n[https://motor.u-car.com.tw/motor/article/77981](https://motor.u-car.com.tw/motor/article/77981)\n\nMore details and info in Gogoro community:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Gogoro/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gogoro/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n",

        "text": "[Original](https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/dramatic-shift-in-market-takes-everyone-by-surprise)\n\nThursday was supposed to be a quiet session as market participants awaited the very important March jobs report, which will be released Friday morning. Instead, it turned into one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year.\n\nThe day started with a gap-up open mainly due to chatter that there is weakness in the job market and that there is a good likelihood that the March jobs news may be softer than expected and trigger a Fed rate cut in June. It was a questionable premise, but it created a little squeeze action and some underlying support.\n\nLater in the day, headlines hit that Fed member Kashkari commented that “if inflation continues to move sideways, it makes me wonder if we should cut rates at all this year.” This isn’t the first hawkish comment from a Fed member, and it probably wouldn’t have had too much of an impact, but then some other more dramatic news hit.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israel, residents were confused when their GPS applications showed that they were located in Lebanon. The reason was that the Israeli military was scrambling GPS signals in preparation for a possible drone attack by Iran. Reports circulated that Israel sees indications that Iran may launch missile/drone attacks from Iranian territory, possibly on Friday. Israeli officials informed the U.S. that an Iranian attack would trigger a response.\n\nThis news caused oil to spike higher, defense contractors to rally, and the market to sell steadily into the close.\n\nThe S&P 500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a matter of a few hours. This has only happened four other times before, according to Jason Goepfert.\n\nIt was a dramatic shift and caught almost everyone by surprise. Sharp intraday reversals are often major turning points.\n\nWe still have the jobs news to deal with Friday morning, and we will see if there actually is an attack on Israel, but the market is now very unsettled. Volatility has spiked, and there should be a major shift in sentiment as a result of this action.\n\nI’ll have more in the morning prior to the jobs news, but that report now has the capacity to accelerate a correction that has been anticipated for several months.\n\nHave a good evening. I’ll see you Friday.\n\nEdit: Kashkari started speaking at 2pm, when the markets were already crashing. Also, the US10Y did not shoot up but dropped instead.\n\n\n\n",

While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states \"our retail partners transition to a storytelling role\" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.\n\nBy transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.\n\nPrice Ranges -\n\n2021 - Low(143) High(195)\n\n2022 - Low(192) High(242)\n\n2023 - Low(179) High(276)\n\n2024 - Low(181) High(209)\n\nShares Outstanding - 204,730,000\n\nDividends Per Share - 2022(1.036 or 1.9%) 2023(1.192 or 2.4%)\n\nRevenue 2022(10.41B) 2023(11.16B)\n\nIncome 2022(1.645B) 2023(1.862B)\n\nTotal Assets - 2022(10.949B) 2023(11.903B)\n\nTotal Liabilities - 2022(7.649B) 2023(7.804B)\n\nMarket Capitalization - 39.79B\n\nBased on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth.",

Based on my reading of the rules it didn't seem to break any of them.\n\nI happened to reply to someone's comment on a post that they could message me if they have questions about understanding options and got hit by almost 10 people in a matter of just a couple of hours (and this is with that offer being hidden deep into a post) so it seems like this may be a good thing to share.\n\nDisclaimer: Not financial advice, may contain errors.\n\nThis is a screenshot from a spreadsheet I put together for a friend a while back:\n\nEdits:\n\n1.

        "text": "NOTE: while the commentary below stands and I expect AMD to underperform the market, given the strong jobs report, I do not recommend shorting AMD.  I believe AMD will underperform the market which has room to run, but there are better players. \n\nAMD's stock has experienced an 8% decline, fueled by speculation \"something\" happened in the middle-east (Iran saber rattling) or something else (interest rate cuts may not happen).  If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.\n\nReality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.\n\nOn the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed \"copilot computers\" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.\n\nGiven these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's \"dead cat bounce (if it comes),\" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.\n\nTake your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.\n\nPS - based on comments a lot of folks lost money in AMD today and I am sorry about that.  Take my advice and don't lose the rest as it declines further from here. It has another 15-20% to go.",

A figure that implied the Q1 estimates would not be hit, estimates that had already been revised down). Because of that, many market participants loaded up on puts before Tuesday, and sold to close between Tuesday and today. So the delta-neutral Market Makers started closing their short positions (that they had opened to hedge) as the puts were being sold by the options buyers, resulting in the price action that we witnessed since Tuesday and which culminated in today's \"unexpected\" move.

This valuation places Carvana at a premium not just relative to auto dealers but also leading tech companies, despite lacking comparable growth prospects or profitability. To reach the current stock price, it's not just necessary for EBITDA per unit to double, but also for vehicle sales and revenue to increase at an improbable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a period of seven years.\n\n**Profitability and Growth Concerns:** Despite efforts to improve profitability to mitigate balance sheet crises, Carvana's growth is challenged. The anticipation for a return to meaningful growth is contradicted by a mere \"slight\" unit growth projection for 1Q24, signaling that profitability enhancements may be nearing their limits.\n\n**Comparison with CarMax:** Carvana's operational metrics, particularly gross profit per retail unit (GPU), have plateaued, reaching levels consistent with CarMax but without exhibiting any remarkable edge over the industry leader. This comparison undermines Carvana's positioning as a disruptor in the auto retail sector. As former Carvana executives said, the company is \"just a dealership. \n\n**Operational Inefficiencies and Market Misconceptions:** Carvana's operational efficiencies and market positioning, suggesting that the company's past growth was achieved by overlooking fundamental industry practices rather than through disruptive innovation. Carvana's improvement strategies, especially in vehicle reconditioning and logistics, largely mimic those of CarMax, challenging the narrative of Carvana as a unique tech-driven entity. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtteaoejzhsc1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8ca0efff42b5bfd2694fc37bb9a7a492443fa6b\n\n**Growth Versus Profitability Dilemma:** Carvana faces a dilemma between pursuing aggressive growth and maintaining profitability. The operational and strategic shifts required for growth could compromise the company's recent profitability achievements, a risk exacerbated by the tight job market and supply constraints in the used vehicle sector.\n\n**Valuation and Price Target:** The price target of $16, a 77% decline from current levels, is based on a 12x multiple to their estimated 2026E EBITDA, aligning Carvana's valuation more closely with CarMax and reflecting the operational and financial realities facing Carvana.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: Active short position, opened Friday.",

This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.\n\nOne notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.\n\nAs Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/04/04/take-two-interactive-to-spend-460-million-to-acqui/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/04/04/take-two-interactive-to-spend-460-million-to-acqui/)",

        "text": "After rolling some of my DJT profits (thanks Cheeto Man) I've been looking for the next play. Recently I found $CYTK, a pharma company that seems to have some interesting trading dynamics and underpriced calls.\n\n**Background/Drug**\n\nNow, this is not a situation where the risk is related to the drug itself. Data has already come out and it was the best in its class for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (disease causing heart attacks). *Do I know this myself bc I am so smart?* Not at all (I'm dumb), but I talked to a cardiologist who was impressed, and it spiked 50% when data came out. \n\nThis lead to acquirer interest a huge spike in January on a buyout rumor:\n\n[Big boi](https://preview.redd.it/g5x4l8fzqhsc1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4a089db7bf9c8aa5a237fda0f782abb62f40385)\n\n[Someone was happy](https://preview.redd.it/7bui9d36rhsc1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=50dee777ea7bcb5ecd204eb6597dca6238f1b7d9)\n\n**Fade**\n\nIt's since traded down on counter-reports that a purchase might not occur as soon or with as much certainty as possible. It seems like perhaps management didn't like the offer they got. Maybe they think it's worth more? *But, from the initial pop to $108, we see that the market thinks in an acquisition, it could roughly be worth at least much.* So why do I think an acquisition is coming?\n\n**Setup for Acquisition**\n\n1. The company is not going to be able to commercialize the drug itself. They've never brought a drug to market and they don't have the infrastructure in place to do so themselves. It just makes no sense at all. So to my mind, they are waiting out for a better offer.\n2. In my view, recent trading patterns have shown a high likelihood that an activist investor is purchasing a large stake. The reason they would do this is to compel management to accept an offer (perhaps a lower one than they are holding out for) sooner rather than later. This way, maybe the sale isn't perfectly optimized, but everyone gets $$$. \n\n**Why do I say that?**\n\nThere was a $50 MILLION purchase towards EOD last week. **This is a massive block trade.** Check out the huge candle and then a few following candles. And yes, I use TDA for data viz not robinhood.\n\n[There's been a few of these mega buys](https://preview.redd.it/nbdh68ywthsc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c502cd0a41220baa4bcdbc856286b23712cfd436)\n\nThis came out the same day that M&A reporter Betaville said that Eli Lily was interested in taking over the company. Now, I don't normally put much stock in rumors, but in this case I looked back and found that this reporter **was also the** ***first*** **to report that $CYTK was a takeover target**, way back in 2023:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8fz7xzluhsc1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=888a9a561ad9a149e19a9e71038abbc1943683f2\n\nI dove into their track record and it's pretty mixed, so take all of that with a heap of salt. But anyways, here's why I am long calls. There are multiple ways to win:\n\n1. Buyout is announced\n2. Stock trades up on anticipation of a buyout into earnings on 5/8\n3. Activist investor involvement is announced, indicating to the market that mgmt will be more likely to sell quick\n4. XBI continues on its run and it trades up in sympathy\n\n**Risk factors**\n\nThe drug is good and has good data, and there's clear acquirer interest. The initial report was from a pretty reputable source, Reuters. So clearly this is an attractive asset. But there is still many risks to consider:\n\n1. Hard to get good fills on options\n2. No way to know when a buyout would come\n3. No way to know IF a buyout would come—management may (stupidly imo) try to go it alone\n4. Competing data could come out and be better, killing the story\n5. Mixed track record of M&A reporters indicates they might not really have insight\n\nThere's a ton more risks and you really need to do your own DD. This is a binary bet so it's super risky. As I've said before, despite being right about DJT on the first day trading (haha) I am an absolute idiot. Do not yolo or follow blindly. \n\n**Positions:**\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/sn4c5f07vhsc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7aedb8d3b59471e851d8a0bd8d862a38c9ee510)\n\nDisclaimer: *This is not financial advice. I have a position. Obviously I am biased. There are major risks and you might lose all that you put in. I might sell on news or price movement if I think the risk/return isn't there anymore.*\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Im not promising tendies with this one but there’s definitely a good theory behind all of this. But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.\n\n## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes\n\nLet’s start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn’t matter much towards the end. But it’s true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria’s cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT. \n\n## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry\n\nLosing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you’re the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit’s about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.\n\n## PMTA Registered List\n\nAltria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don’t even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They’re all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.\n\nSo Altria’s bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it… until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.\n\n## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape\n\nSo Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you’re underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA’s tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they’ll get it if they approve.\n\n## Altria’s On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor\n\nIn case you didn’t know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they’re expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).\n\nOne of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.\n\n## Altria’s “Moving Beyond Smoking” Plan\n\nAltria is dead set on its new campaign, “[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)”. They know smoking rates are declining so they’re repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That’s why Morningstar says they’re worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it’s a value stock.\n\n## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev\n\nAltria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they’re out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we’ll be eating tendies and banging their wives.\n\nPositions $MO 47.5c 6/21, 50c 6/21, $PM 100c 4/26",

        "text": "Hello, fellow regards. I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  \n\n\nThe potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...\n\nHere are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:\n\n​\n\n# Report 1 (Financials) \n\nAdeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.\n\nFinancially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).\n\nThe valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia’s trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.\n\nOn the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.\n\nGiven its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.\n\n# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) \n\nBased on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.\n\nAdeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs​​​​.\n\nAdeia's hybrid bonding technology stands as a testament to the company's long-standing commitment to advancing the semiconductor industry. Over the past 30 years, Adeia has made fundamental advances in the field, holding an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that covers not just hybrid bonding but also advanced process nodes and packaging technologies​​​​. This latest development underscores Adeia's role in driving innovation in semiconductor technologies, which could have broad implications for the industry's future.",

These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company’s fiscal health in 2024.\n\nGiven the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.\n\n\nI dont have financial advice but buying stock at the dip and holding long or buying leaps the safer bet to me, but we’re on wsb bay bay.

The market initially didn't like the deal, sending EQT's stock tumbling - creating an undervalued opportunity that I pounced on around $34.\n\nHowever, after taking a nice profit by exiting my position in the $36.80s, EQT has continued grinding higher, now stabilizing north of $37. A few factors seem to be pressuring the stock - excess natural gas supply, Biden's unfavorable energy policies, and an overall tough market backdrop for the sector.\n\nThat said, with EQT appearing to find its footing, I suspect the rebound could continue towards the $45 level. For now, I'm staying on the sidelines to watch the price action play out. But I may re-establish a position if we get another dip towards $36, although that may not materialize for a while.\n\nThe energy trade remains volatile, but EQT's beaten down levels presented an attractive risk/reward, especially as it hasn't run up compared to its other energy peers (of course given nat gas has continued to be depressed).

        "text": "Dear Forum Members,\n\nToday, I want to highlight the compelling case for investing in Entain stock (LSE: ENT) and why it holds significant potential for substantial growth in the near future.\n\nEntain’s presence in the European market is poised to receive a significant boost this year, thanks to two major sporting events: the UEFA European Football Championship and the Olympic Games. These events command massive attention across Europe, translating into a surge in sports betting activity. Entain, with its substantial market share in Europe, is well-positioned to capitalize on this increased demand for betting services. With sports events gradually returning to their regular schedule, we can anticipate a surge in revenue for Entain, as it leverages its stronghold in the sports betting sector.\n\nMoreover, let’s delve into the low price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of Entain, which stands at just 12.62 for 2025, according to Finanzen.net. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued relative to its earnings, making it an attractive investment opportunity. As investors, this presents an opportunity to acquire Entain shares at a relatively low valuation, with the potential for significant upside as the company continues to grow its revenue and profitability.\n\nAnother aspect worth considering is the growth potential of Entain’s subsidiary, BetMGM, in the burgeoning U.S. sports betting market. With the gradual liberalization of sports betting regulations across various states in the U.S., BetMGM stands to benefit significantly. The company has been making strategic investments and partnerships to strengthen its position in this lucrative market, positioning itself as a key player poised for substantial growth in the coming years. In February BetMGM signed an exclusive Betting Partnership with X, which will lead to further growth in the US in near-term. \n\nFurthermore, there's speculation surrounding a potential reacquisition of Entain by MGM Resorts International, driven by the current low stock price of Entain. This lower valuation might prompt Entain to consider strategic options to create value for its shareholders. One such option could involve selling its 50% stake in BetMGM, as Entain might feel pressured to enhance shareholder value amidst the low stock price. This scenario adds an intriguing dimension to Entain's stock outlook, as it navigates the possibility of strategic moves to unlock shareholder value amidst changing market dynamics. While these possibilities remain speculative, they underscore the importance of monitoring Entain's strategic decisions in light of its current valuation and market conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, Entain’s stock presents a compelling investment opportunity, supported by factors such as its strong position in the European market, low price-to-earnings ratio, growth prospects in the U.S. through BetMGM, and the possibility of a strategic acquisition by MGM Resorts International.\n\nI welcome your thoughts and further discussion on this investment opportunity.",

Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  \n\nWhile the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.\n\nA few reasons I'm backing up the truck on ULTA here:\n\n💰 Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data\n\n💄 Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way\n\n💯 Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year\n\nWhile it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.\n\nThe panel is lit up to buy ULTA aggressively under $450.

        "text": "Hear me out…So Canada Goose recently cut 17% of their total workforce. This is the second cut in less than a year (last cut August 2023)\n\nThey have impressive YoY revenue growth from an increase in store count, strong sales from existing locations, high direct to consumer growth (including online sales). Goose’s revenue performance in Asia Pacific is wild compared to North America which is also doing great. All this leads me to believe they are VERY UNDERVALUED. \n\nGoose has an aggressive growth objective of $3 Billion in sales by 2028. Their forward P/E ratio as of today is 9.54 and without NRI 16.16. If you look at LVMH and Hermes forward P/E, they trade at 25.55 and 52.36 as of today. Gooses current market cap is now $1.52 billion (down from $2 billion). They could easily be purchased by one of the big boys (notice LVMH doesn’t have an outdoor brand). I also learned that Goose may have axed their new travel retail program (opening stores in airports) which was launched last year. Furthermore I’m seeing Bain Capital leaders being injected into Sr Management for ex: Beth Clymer who was brought in last year as President of Finance, Culture/People, Strategy and Legal (which is a really weird combination of departments under one person). Bain Capital is also their biggest shareholder where she was EVP  and her title still says Private Equity Operating Partner. They’ve hired BCG to oversee a transformation and seems like they’re about to rebrand given their new product lines.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThey have consistent and strong sales growth, expansion plans, bolstered leadership, diversifying their product line (shoes, hats, summer and spring wear etc) and IMO they trade at a major discount. These cuts are telling me they are shedding the fat and maybe preparing for a sale. \n\nI could be dead WRONG and people in here might shred my ass for it lol. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Have a look and tell me what you think…",

        "title": "Multiple Plays The Markets Are About To Notice",
        "text": "The obvious top play is $MU (Micron). \n\nThis bad boy was overlooked while everyone stared at AI. The part that made it juicy is that it's a supportive play for AI. As those processors crunch bytes at amazing speeds, that data needs to come from somewhere and go somewhere else.\n\nStorage is the big play here. \n\nThey've almost sold out the next 2 years with locked in prices and deposits paid up front. There won't be any layoffs for the 43,000 full time employees. There's also a good chance they expand operations and go on a hiring spree.\n\nYou'll see some wild price swings as shorts do everything they can to get the f\\*ck out of this one before shit really gets crazy.\n\nShort term estimate: $200+ before settling down around $180 in the next 6 months.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext up are $SPY and $IVV.\n\nYou can't really go wrong on this one. When the top holdings are mostly tech companies and Buffett uses it to win bets, arrogant shorts tend to get a little crazy and overstep their bounds quite often.\n\nThis is the mac daddy of ETF's and can't possibly lose in the long run.\n\nIf a stock performs poorly, it gets kicked to the curb and a new one gets introduced.\n\nRight now though, in relation to shorts mistaking this for the year 1999, they've put themselves in a precarious position once again as tech companies actually have a plan this time.\n\nShort term estimate: $530 by end of next week\n\nLong term (EOY): $600+\n\nA twin to this is $IVV. \n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF \n\nThe holdings are the same as $SPY and will move in lock-step.\n\nIf one goes up or down, the other will do the same.\n\nHere's a comparison of the 2:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icv5sbuz4bsc1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5282af98c78843273eb97506b7749b25552f8d5\n\nPrice Estimate: Same as $SPY\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next play is $NVDA.\n\nWith new partnerships, sales and hype daily, shorts have completely f\\*cked themselves on this one with nowhere to run. Averaging up is their only play because they aren't smart enough to take the loss.\n\nI would say there's been enough information posted about them on here, so I'll cut this short and show you their current dark pool short position of $-97,038,220,000:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yfmgio9v5bsc1.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc9a636756bf7dba6b0714898d23e53fb63f372\n\nWhen this blows (very shortly), you're looking at an easy target of $1,400-$1,500 before settling in to $1,300 after the tears of Hedge Funds fill the streets.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext up is $AMD.\n\nAgain, it comes up a lot in this sub but there's a few key things that don't.\n\nThe short position is over extended but most importantly, the recent hire of Thomas Zacharia is a bigger deal than people realize. \n\nHe came from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In his 35 years there, he worked with industry leaders in tech, government, businesses and military.\n\nBy businesses, I'm not talking about Walmart. I mean the ones who design and build infrastructure.\n\n“Thomas is a distinguished leader with decades of experience successfully creating public/private partnerships that have resulted in consistently deploying the world’s most powerful and advanced computing solutions, including the world’s fastest supercomputer Frontier” \n\nThat quote alone, says a lot.\n\nNot only can he call up the CEO of companies and world leaders, they'll answer the phone. The man has the world at his fingertips and now has AMD at his disposal.\n\nWorking at Oak Ridge would've been loaded with babysitting as they're responsible for the production of nuclear isotopes and funded by the Department of Energy.\n\nOnce this guy settles in, opens up his Rolodex, realizes his new found freedom, AMD will be well on its way.\n\nShort term target (caused by a short explosion): $275\n\nLong term with a solid dividend: $250 followed by a steady rise.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo that I'm grouping together are Joby Aviation (JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR). There are others but their market caps are too small at this point.\n\neVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing*)* companies are going to be huge once they take off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Joby eVTOL](https://preview.redd.it/0xgynyxqhbsc1.png?width=1756&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e243094f0665f3d1a8cf7b17a69d40a7ec2e28a)\n\nThey won't be taking off until early 2025 and the earliest. This is due to FAA approval on what is a brand new technology that's about to hit the skies.\n\nThe appeal of this play is that these methods of travel are more nimble in urban environments than helicopters and cars.\n\nWithout the need for a runway, waiting at a gate and sniffing farts, you can be lifted straight into the air, skip over the city and be set down at your destination. \n\nThis obviously won't be what the everyday citizen is using as a method of transportation. This will be bank executives, hedge fund managers, CEO's and politicians that need to move quickly. \n\nOther possible use cases are news channels that want to report on the traffic, weather and car chases. Police and emergency E-vac are definitely possibilities as well.\n\nBoth companies have already made deliveries to military installations and plan to deliver more. Think of the scene in Avatar when the Na'vi home gets obliterated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4denis5ebsc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=3470e228f7d1a0f2fcad3b3b33a719b75d4bc3b0\n\nWith their current ranges of a couple hundred miles at a couple hundred miles and hour, they're perfect for city environments and short range operations. With the added benefit of being fully electric and quiet, they'll come with a much higher acceptance than you're current helicopter.\n\nHere's the one thing that should be seriously noted on these:\n\n# THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY!\n\nAs noted above, they can't make any income from sales until they receive FAA approval.\n\nThey're currently on stage 4 of 5. \n\n(1) certification basis\n\n(2) planning and standards\n\n(3) analysis and testing \n\n(4)  final decision and certification of design \n\n(5)  Showing and Verifying where the results of the testing are verified by the FAA. Upon successful completion of this stage, a type certification is issued. \n\nIf the stock jumps at all before Q1, 2025, it will be hype at best and not hold. If you want to get in early, all good but you should be planning to have that cash tied up for a while.\n\nWith Toyota backing Joby and Daimler backing Archer, you know that these two (and others) have what they need to make this a reality.\n\nShort term target: Nothing meaningful\n\nLong term target: Only up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have OTM calls in most of the above plays. Nothing all that spectacular as I'm currently poor. This will change as the above list starts paying off.\n\nI also have a Youtube channel where I hunt these down, show how I did it and call them out.\n\nRule 13 prevents linking it.\n\nI'll have another list for you tomorrow. I'll limit these posts to 5 stocks per day moving forward so they're more in depth as \"currently unknown\" tickers come up.",

        "text": "Gather round and follow me down this regarded trail, I stumbled upon this looking at midstream pipeline companies originally inspired by the PAA trade (and other companies) mentioned in a few posts on this sub recently.  I saw a press release that Diamondback Energy (FANG) had signed a letter of interest (non-binding) in small nuclear reactors to power remote oil/gas rigs in.  Small nuclear reactors would replace large diesel generators.\n\n [U.S. shale producers to reduce Permian drilling emissions, increase reliability with nucle](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/4/1/u-s-shale-drillers-to-reduce-permian-drilling-emissions-increase-reliability-with-nuclear-reactors/)  \n[ar reactors (worldoil.com)](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/4/1/u-s-shale-drillers-to-reduce-permian-drilling-emissions-increase-reliability-with-nuclear-reactors/) \n\nI've been interested in the small nuclear reactor trade for a few months since I learned about Centrus Energy (LEU).  So I looked into OKLO -- which turns out is about to go public via spac with ticker $ALCC it will trade under ticker $OKLO once merger is complete.  Sam Altman CEO of Open AI is Chairman of the board at OKLO and ALCC is his SPAC.\n\nDetails of the merger are here:\n\n [Oklo Inc. - Oklo, an Advanced Fission Technology Company, to Go Public via Merger with AltC Acquisition Corp.](https://oklo.com/newsroom/news-details/2023/Oklo-an-Advanced-Fission-Technology-Company-to-Go-Public-via-Merger-with-AltC-Acquisition-Corp/) \n\nHighlights of merger include a long lock up period and this merger is quoted as \"not being done to give early investors a chance to cash out.\"  Transaction values Oklo at 850M (holds 516M in cash) and this transaction provides another 500M of capital for continued operations.  ALCC market cap today is 580M.  There is immediate value above todays trading price there. Merger is expected to go through in Q2 2024\n\nAmendment to SEC Form S-4 was filed yesterday. Viewable here (maybe).  Multiple filings with SEC posted this week.    \n [XBRL Viewer (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm) \n\nSam also put up 375M of the 500M recently raised by Helion-- a nuclear FUSION company--for larger scale applications.  They are not direct competitors because OKLO is focused on small FISSION reactors 15-50MW and Helion is focused on FUSION.  For reference, 15MW is enough to power about 3000 Single Family Homes.\n\n [Oklo Inc. - Home](https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx)  \\-- lots of information on their website.\n\n  \n\\--Oklo has been around since 2013.  They are going public to support the buildout of their facilities in Idaho and Ohio.    \n\\--Sam got involved in 2014 when he was president of Y combinator.  This is a bet on Sam, his knowledge, connections, and his belief that we will need nuclear power to support our AI ambitions.    \n\\--Technology used in the proposed Oklo reactor has been around since the 1960s.  This will help with regulatory approvals.   \n\\--Public and political opinions surrounding nuclear power are trending more favorable.  Meaning nuclear is still up for discussion regardless of who wins the election in November.  \n\\--We are continually consuming more and more power.  We will have to scale up our output somehow.  All signs are pointing to that additional power coming from nuclear.  \n\n\nThere is more to this but I am out of time.

        "text": "Ok here’s the deal.  We all remember the hype when Canada legalized.  Everyone thought it was the ultimate infinite money glitch.\n\nAnd for a while, based on the hype, it was.  Canada was the first major first world country to outright legalize (sorry Netherlands your half measures are no good for stonks), and the outlook was looking good for US legalization.  We had a boomer Republican president in the US at the time, but one who was decidedly less hostile to Marijuana than the typical boomer Republican.  Speaking of boomers…their parents who grew up watching reefer madness and blamed all crime on Mexican reefer addicts and always voted 98% no to any loosening of marijuana laws were finally starting to fucking die.  No one under 40 still thought it should be illegal and the national pulse had finally turned in favor of legalizing nationwide in the US.  Everyone saw it coming imminently.\n\nBut Canada is a nation of 38 million.  Barely a single major city in the US.  Not nearly enough to justify the size and scope of the weed market that emerged.  The stonks soared.  I remember ACB at 200 times it’s current price.\n\nBut it slowly dawned that no, in fact, America wasn’t going to reschedule, let alone legalize.  There wasn’t going to be a big enough market to support all the infrastructure the Canadian firms invested in.  The stocks cratered and a lot of degenerates lost a lot of money.\n\nThen Biden, a democrat, gets elected….the democrats being the party who overwhelmingly support legalization, it stood to reason that a liberalization of American marijuana law was imminent and again the stocks popped, though nowhere near the 2019 highs.  This is where I jumped in (MJ ETF, ACB and OGI)…and again, it slowly dawned that US legalization was going nowhere…and again the stocks slowly waned, punctuated occasionally by big pops on irrelevant news like another state legalizing…each time I thought this was it, this time it turns around for good.\n\nI lost like 75% before giving up and selling my shares, and good thing I did, because I’d have lost another 75% had I sat on it.\n\nNow Germany just legalized and again the stocks are popping and a lot of us can’t see past these old painful memories.  I get it.\n\nJust hear me out.\n\nNow keep in mind right off the bat Germany is a much bigger nation and economy than Canada (>2X the population and 2x the GDP, roughly).  It alone can support a much larger market than Canada.  So the pop in weed stocks we’ve seen now is already justified and yet they still have tremendous upside.\n\nBut my fellow regards, this is just the warmup round.\n\nJoe Brandon is in trouble.  He’s behind in the polls, he’s seen as old, stuffy and senile.  His oldness, stuffiness and senility are perfectly encapsulated by his antiquated commitment to continuing marijuana prohibition.  It’s worth noting that he is the leader of a party that abandoned its commitment to marijuana prohibition decades ago and while he’s stubbornly been clinging to it more and more of the old fuddie duddie hardliners have died and almost no one in the country still supports continuing prohibition.  Certainly almost no democrats.  Also, RFK is running as an independent and he has confirmed he will make marijuana legalization a priority.  While RFK will be pulling support from trump too (think Covid hoaxery) I am convinced he’ll be pulling harder from Brandon.\n\nBrandon needs something big to revitalize his campaign, and he’s been dropping hints that marijuana very well could be that thing.  April is “second chance month” and this year he went further than before in his commentary on the topic, suggesting rescheduling and/or hinting at legalization.  Kamala Harris has been pressuring the DEA to take action now.  Things are happening that are unlike anything from 2019 or 2021.  Traditionally 4/20 is associated with marijuana and the bettor in me senses something big may be coming this month, possibly on or around that day.\n\nYes, marijuana stocks are up somewhat on German legalization, but still down well over 90 to 95% or more from the 2019 highs.\n\nI’m not saying YOLO on weed calls.  But picking up some shares right now is a relatively low risk (the stocks are already so so so far downbeaten with residual pessimism) move with tremendous potential upside.\n\nTLDR; buy weed stonks before 4/20\n\nPosition (edited to reflect additions since OP): 5,000 Tilray in at 2.41.  2,000 SNDL at 2.40.  500 ACB at 6.90.  800 CURLF at 5.45.  500 CGC at 9.55.  No options (NB4 ‘if you really believes in your DD you’d YOLO your life savings into calls’, I’m 40 years old and have 4 kids, I can’t afford the risk.  I don’t fuck with options, ever).\n\nI’ve read some DDs on here that convince me Tilray is the strongest play.  Pick whatever suits you.\n\nThis is not financial advice.  I’m a regard\n\n********\n\nSome more edits.\n\n1) German legalization not being true commercial legalization.\n\nTrue and a valid point.  The play here is not on German legalization.  The play is on an anticipation of a forthcoming change in US law.  Apart from being the worlds largest economy, the US has been the stick bearer enforcing marijuana prohibition around the world.  Many nations have wanted to legalize in the past but have been held back by the UN convention on psychtropic drugs from the 70s…the U.S. has been the standard bearer of enforcement of that convention.  Once the US legalizes, I think that this UN convention loses relevancy and the dominoes will start falling in short order and many more nations will legalize.  The smart money knows this and the bulk of the movement in the stock will all happen once the US announces meaningful change.  The play is to get ahead of that announcement.\n\n2) edited GDP ratio of Germany to Canada because yes that data point was off\n\n3) if y’all can’t handle some embellishment I can’t help you.  The NYC metro area is 23M people.  Canada has 38M.  I think it’s fair to say 38M, as the population of one of the world’s top economies, “barely” exceeds that of a single city’s metropolitan area.  Yes you regards, the specific data point  is embellished to emphasize the fact that the US has 10 times the population and 12 times the GDP of its northern neighbor.  It’s a much much bigger deal.  When you consider the likelihood of copycat legalizations in the wake of US moves, now is the time!",

Today, even though other stonks are recovering, this one is still going down.\n\nI have not been able to find any news on what could be triggering this sell off. Tipranks and marketwatch both gave strong buy/buy ratings and haven't changed their ratings since. Hell, I'm pretty sure I saw TPR on a \"top S&P500 companies\" list this week on /wsb (can't find the post anymore)\n\nCalls are super cheap for earnings in may. 5/17 50$ calls going for 0.85$ when they were trading for up to 2$ just this month and 2.5$ last month.\n\nI don't see why this thing wouldn't recover to at least 48$ in the next week or two, given no apparent selloff trigger.\n\nTLDR: TPR sold off for no apparent reason, expecting a rebound. Loaded up a small bag of 5/17 50$ calls for earnings",

While taking the difference of revenues and net income, it is provided there is a substantially increasing cost of goods sold. This can mean an entity is becoming less profitable overtime, or a market is swaying away from the trend of purchasing a firms goods/services in an industry/sector. As of writing this, $LEVI's price-per-share is $19.00 with a TTM basic EPS of 0.97. This provides a standing P/E ratio of 19.59, a fair P/E based on historical data. Assuming retention of the 19.59 P/E and following a 0.21 Q1 basic EPS, $LEVI's predicted pricing will fall to $16.26. This is a predicted 14.4% decrease. Other firms such as $NKE and $LULU fell between the ranges of \\[6.9%,15.8%\\] showing a 14.4% decrease is within the realm of possibilities.",

        "text": "I’ve been following Chesapeake Energy since January, when they announced a $7.4 billion acquisition of rival SWN – Southwestern Energy, but over the Easter weekend I finally had time to delve into the details. My original hunch has been confirmed so here’s my write up.\n\nCHK restructured during Covid and over the past few years has been buying up its regional rivals – Vine Energy in 2021, Chief Oil & Gas in 2022, and now SWN in 2024. Despite this it has over a billion dollars in cash and nearly 2 billion if you count short-term investments. As the macroeconomic environment stabilises we should now begin to see these investments being realised and, after thinking all week about how to play this, I have decided to ride SWN (the company which will be merging into CHK) upwards all the way to the merger and beyond, as this should maximise upside potential.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Merger on track for Q2 2024, this will make the new CHK-SWN combination the largest US natural gas producer, period.\n\n* Expect SWN to continue its upwards trajectory as interest ramps up closer to the time and investors seek ways to play the US energy market this summer.\n\n* $7.4 billion acquisition value provides a price floor significantly limiting any downside risk\n\n* Natural gas becoming crucial to national security, demand is rising increasing existing profits and making new developments profitable\n\n* SWN is sitting on 2.5 million undeveloped acres in Canada. Currently unable to be developed due to Canada’s ban on hydraulic fracturing, however should the winds change later this year SWN’s historic highs in the $40s (in 2014 before the fracking ban) give us an indication of how high it could rise. Note that this last point is a long shot but not essential – it would only be the cherry on top of the icing.\n\nRisks:\n\n* The FTC will be following this merger due to antitrust concerns. However, in my view the Biden administration will not risk alienating key states such as Pennsylvania (where most of SWN’s activities are) and Texas (its headquarters) in an election year. Also, CHK's past acquisitions have all gone through, and, with no news since Jan and the Q2 date coming up, everything is on track as expected.\n\n\nPositions:\n\n* Half in SWN Jan 2025 $10 strike leaps, the other half in shares. Play shorter expirations if you are feeling riskier. This is not financial advice.",

        "text": "The following Due Diligence is pretty simple and straightforward. \n\nSolventum operates in the medical/nursing care industry and provides many commodities and hardware to dental clinics, hospitals and medical institutions/research facilities. Think about scalpels, gloves, respiratory equipment, bandages, teeth fillings and crowns, x-ray and other dental equipment, and also some medical electronic hardware/software and filtration and purification systems.\n\nCurrently( April 3rd, 2024), in their **specific** industry, they have the highest ROA( 9.78%), 5th highest ROE( 11.5%) and the highest ROIC(11.43%). Their debt to equity ratio is 0.01 and cash to debt ratio of 1.98, both of which are very good. In fact, even though they are spin-off, they basically have no liabilities and actually have a negative net debt (excess cash) of 96 million dollars, according to their December 2023 reports. \n\nJoel Greenblatt, a legendary investor who made a significant amount of his fortune thanks to spin-offs and wrote a book about his experiences, emphasizes the potential upside such newly founded companies can present to investors. Usually, when a spin-off is completed, Mr Market creates a bearish attitude towards the stock and sends it down. It can occur several days or weeks after the spin-offs' IPO and it creates a lucrative buying opportunity. \n\nRight now, I'm waiting for such an opportunity to manifest.\n\n \\-10%, -15%, -20% are normal occurrences with spin-offs short time after an IPO. \n\nI see here a potential repeat of GE HealthCare, GE's spin off from last year, where the stock plummeted in the range of -10% days after the IPO and both GEHC and SOLV operate in the medical sector( albeit slightly different focuses). Now its true that GE itself outperformed its Spin off by a large margin, but I suspect it was both the fact that the company was improving its fundamentals, Chris Hohn's involvement with the company and also perhaps because of a heavy bullish pressure from buyers to be eligible to own its future spin-off, Vernova. \n\nI think we can all agree here that 3M is a dumpster fire and will continue to lose value for its shareholders, at least for the next 12 months.\n\nFull disclosure, I own some KLG stock, spin-off to K, and I bought it around November-December after it dropped 40% in October last year **and** after 6 insiders purchased 2 million worth of stock. \n\nI missed out on a buying opportunity with WS, a spin-off to WOR, after it dropped -19% several days after its IPO( there was no real reason, just sucking my thumb honestly). \n\nIt is true that not all spin-offs are created equal. However, those that come from well-established, old and mature enterprises, from traditional industries and sectors, perhaps current( and former) industry leaders, offer rare upside for *RELATIVELY* low risk.\n\nThat's about it, folks.\n\nGood luck to you all, fellow regards!",

I remembered that Taiwan is on the \"Ring of Fire\"**\n\n**AKA where all the tectonic plates hit each other a ton creating volcanoes and ELEVATED EARTHQUAKE RISK.**\n\n**\\*\\*QUESTIONS TO ASK\\*\\***\n\n**1) Why would TSMC not consider \"Ring of Fire\" in their own contingency/safety plans?**\n\n**2) Why would Nvidia and AMD lawyers not put in clauses requiring elevated safety standards and precautions to offset risk?**\n\n**Article 1:** [**TSMC Case Study - Earthquakes**](https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/governance/caseStudy/1/index.html)\n\n**Article 2:** [**Shock Absorbers Help Taiwan Chip Plants Avoid Quake Damage**](https://www.asiafinancial.com/shock-absorbers-help-taiwan-chip-plants-avoid-quake-damage)\n\n**Key Points from Article 1:**\n\n* Following the September 21, 1999, Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, TSMC has laid down a series of earthquake protection management plans surpassing legal requirements. The company has conducted a comprehensive investigation on all buildings and facilities, set up dampers to improve building structures, and adopted new anti-seismic technologies and methodologies to assess and control the risks.\n* TSMC's strategy is to simultaneously enhance the seismic resistance of facilities along with emergency response skills. On February 6, 2016, another earthquake struck southern Taiwan, in Mei-Nong District of Kaohsiung. It was the most powerful earthquake experienced by TSMC Fab 6 and Fab 14 in Tainan Science Park. With the above antiseismic methodologies, TSMC's Fabs were safe from structural damage, chemical leakage, process tools misalignment, fire and casualty.\n\n|2000|\n\nThe seismic coefficient was improved beyond legal requirements by as much as 25% for main structure of new buildings, 50% for nonstructural components. New seismic anchorage was installed onto equipment and facilities.\n\n|2008|\n\nThe greatest potential earthquake hazard analysis of each site, evaluation of anti-seismic ability of hardware facilities. Dampers were installed along with new Fab; seismic response was reduced by 15 - 20%.\n\n|2012|\n\nFloating piles were installed in new Fabs of Tainan Science Park, which decreased seismic amplitude by 25% in the Fabs. Evaluation of raised floor shaking table test and improvement of process tool anchorage.\n\n|2013\n\nInstallation of seismic isolation platform onto furnace tool.\n\n|2015|\n\nEstablishment of Earthquake Early Warning System. \n\n|2016|\n\nAdditional stoppers were installed for tower stocker to prevent sliding and ceiling bracings added to strengthen ceiling.\n\n**The guiding principles of TSMC earthquake management policy are \"Zero casualty, short operation recovery time and least impact on customers\". Cross-Fabs post-earthquake emergency response procedures and business continuity plans were established according to these guiding principles. Constantly and systematically, TSMC minimizes damage caused by earthquakes and enhances anti-seismic ability.**\n\n**Article 2:**\n\n# Shock Absorbing Plant Designs\n\n“In terms of foundries, due to shock-absorbing plant designs, earthquake vibrations inside fabs are one level of magnitude less than outside,” the semiconductor group said in a note on Monday, adding that it had received no reports of substantial factory damage.\n\n“In the worst case, some machinery required initialization after crashing,” it said. “In terms of memory, [**Nanya Technology**](https://www.nanya.com/en/) has already carried out a shutdown inspection. If there was any wafer damage, Nanya maintains sufficient inventory to compensate.”\n\nMeanwhile, [**Micron**](https://www.micron.com/) had recalled engineers to inspect its equipment “and has confirmed no losses. Thus, the capacity utilization rate of these two companies has not been affected nor has supply,” the TrendForce report said.\n\nIn regard to panel makers, it said the panel industry was currently on a down cycle because of serious sustained oversupply issues.\n\n“Panel makers are reducing production in succession.

But the power supply in the Kaohsiung area was not affected by the quake and production line sintering furnaces remained in normal operation, the report said.\n\n# Taiwan’s Importance\n\nIt is worth noting that Taiwan’s importance to the manufacturing of semiconductors, or computer chips, is similar to Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in OPEC and the global oil trade.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the self-ruled island’s biggest company, has a [**more than half of the global foundry market**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf), while other Taiwan-based manufacturers claim a further 10% of the market.\n\nOne of the reasons for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the island last month was allegedly to [**convince TSMC to set up a manufacturing base in the United States**](https://theconversation.com/taiwan-dominates-the-worlds-supply-of-computer-chips-no-wonder-the-us-is-worried-188242).\n\nIt’s big money – the global semiconductor market was worth more than $520 billion in 2021. And with chips used in so many products these days, the sector’s importance has risen dramatically.\n\nPeople in Taiwan are probably saying a quiet prayer of thanks that the weekend’s quakes were not a lot worse\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ov865d3w6sc1.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c8177f322aea0bff550bbc3528358087a715173\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sik55d3w6sc1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dceb0203e27773809b6692e2b88b004b1e27523",

        "text": "I keep reading posts about Intel and consumer CPU's or GPU's. It is relatively insignificant if they sell some shitty GPU's for a new xbox. The real money is in datacenters and AI, specifically AI accelerators and inference chips for training / running models quickly. Nvidia has been the king with their monopoly-like features (optimisation, their ecosystem, CUDA, etc..), but Intel is making some serious moves. \n\nIn the latest MLPerf benchmark from just a few days ago, which tests AI chips on tasks like object detection and large language models, Intel's Gaudi 2 is showing impressive results. Not to get too technical, but even David Salvator, Nvidia director of accelerated computing products, acknowledged that Intel's chip is actually competitive \\[1\\]. While Nvidia remains on top, price / performance wise Gaudi 2 beat them in Stable Diffusion and was close in the large language model. (Yes this is only inference - so does not reflect training, but this still shows potential). Intel said Gaudi 2 delivered a massive 1.42x jump in performance compared to their previous gen in just one year.\n\nThe generative AI market is estimated to hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, and we're in a unique position to guess who will be selling the shovels. As a bonus: Intel will be hugely susceptible to being hyped up during an AI bubble.\n\nBesides all this, we know that the Biden admin just announced Intel is getting up to $8.5B in direct funding under the CHIPS Act, along with a 25% tax credit on over $100B in investments and eligibility for $11B in federal loans.\n\nIntel could be a hedge against Nvidia, as they rely on TSMC. If geopolitical shit hits the fan, it could affect TSMC, which would impact Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others leaving intel as the only serious option.\n\n**TLDR**: Intel's AI Chip is no Nvidia killer yet, but Intel's making solid progress. $INTC could be an interesting AI play. Pie is big enough.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/03/28/mlperf-inference-4-0-results-showcase-genai-nvidia-still-dominates/](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/03/28/mlperf-inference-4-0-results-showcase-genai-nvidia-still-dominates/)",

They have been acquiring clubs and growing at a steady pace now for the past few years. As I basic-fit member I can tell you that they have the strongest most recognizable brand of any gym in western Europe  and are not slowing down their growth. When their annual reports dropped investors were displeased because they did not turn a profit because of their high lease and energy costs of new clubs. \n\nI believe however the that the 15% drop is was a massive overreaction especially since the share price was already very low. I think it is time for $BFIT.NV to pump as hard as my muscles. The annual results were not nearly bad enough. Nearly ever figure was up from last year and their revenue is at an all-time high even the negative net profit was better than last year. I mean seriously the share price has not been this low since covid what more can I say. \n\nSo $BFIT.NV is definitely in for a large correction by the next month before the results of the first quarter, the most profitable time of the year for gyms .Or to put it simply “buy the dip fgt”.

Their public image and credibility as a serious aero company is in the gutter. \n\nThey’ve had a massive executive shuffle, stock’s down 27.30% ytd, and Airbus is somewhere out there praying on their downfall. \n\nBUT, \n\nTheir fundamentals are still strong, realistically in 10 years Boeing will still most likely be out and about making airplanes and defence systems.

According to the short report I linked, microstrategy as of March 19 has 214,246 bitcoin and as of this writing the price of bitcoin is around 66,500 which comes out to a total value of 14,247,359,000 dollars. Microstrategy's market cap after hours is currently 27.8 billion.\n\nI took a look at their annual report to see if perhaps the business outside of bitcoin is worth anything on its own, and from what I can tell, it isn't worth much. The company basically runs at break even if not at a slight loss when you remove the impact of bitcoin, and this doesn't account for the debt on the balance sheet and that the company will have to pay taxes on any realized gain from any sale.\n\nThe IV on the options are insanely high so I'm strongly considering selling OTM call credit spreads. After hours option chains are always funky, but 5/17 expiration options in the 1700's range depending on liquidity were what I was thinking.\n\nAm I regarded or might this actually be a good idea?",

Most people have experienced PM through the most iconic American cigarette brand - Marlboro.  Besides Marlboro, PM owns some of the most popular cigarettes worldwide - Parliament, Chesterfield, Virginia Slims, and more.  [PM also recently acquired Swedish Match last year](https://www.swedishmatch.com/globalassets/documents/presentations/2023_companypresentation_swedishmatch_en.pdf). \n\nSwedish Match is the largest and most successful company when it comes to oral nicotine pouches. Their biggest brands include General, Göteborgs Rapé, and, most importantly, ZYN.  ZYN has been blowing up in the media over the past year. Most notably Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and many professional baseball players have been walking advertisments for ZYN pouches. \n\nThis word-of-mouth advertising has done wonders for Swedish Match, and therefore Philip Morris as well.   From the [Q4 2023 Earnings Release](https://philipmorrisinternational.gcs-web.com/static-files/33e7f95e-90d2-4883-91d8-df2446d176d0):  \n\n\\> \"ZYN nicotine pouch shipment volume in the U.S. of 116.3 million cans, representing growth of 78.2% versus fourth-quarter 2022 Swedish Match shipments of 65.3 million cans\" \n\n\\> \"Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 increased by 11.0%, excluding currency, driven primarily by the organic growth in adjusted operating income, as well as the results of the Swedish Match business and its strong performance led by ZYN in the U.S.\"\n\n \\> \"Nicotine pouch shipment volume increased by 68.6% compared to Swedish Match's fourth-quarter 2022 shipment volume of 73.8 million cans, mainly driven by 78.2% growth for ZYN in the U.S. -- an outstanding performance that reflected continued broad strength across the country. In Scandinavia, shipment volume for nicotine pouches grew by 3.0%\"  \n\nAnyone who has tried ZYN knows that these things are AWESOME, and [the public agrees](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/zyn-nicotine-pouches-18713916.php) \n\nNow, same with Juul back around 2018, we all know the most loyal and dedicated customers for tobacco alternatives: ~~Ex-smokers~~ children. ZYN has blown up all over TikTok in a way that vaping could not. Lately, the news has been spreading about smokeless nicotine appearing on underaged users' social media, but this has been going on for much longer. These pouches have slowly been taking place of vapes for underaged users over the past year, most notably among college students. However, there's been a large recent uptick in use among high-schoolers due to both the fact that it is seen as \"healthier\" than vaping, as well as that it can be done easily without being caught. \n\nFor the past year, ZYN has been set up to be the next Juul - the perfect form of nicotine for those who have to hide their use. I believe this quarter's earnings and next are going to reflect the social media popularity of oral nicotine pouches.  This really is like investing into Juul before it made its way into the schools.\n\nConsider these factors: \n\nPM has been considered a strong-moderate buy YTD \n\nI'm literally just banking on enough teens buying ZYNs that PM made money. I'm assuming everything else will be the same as last quarter \n\n~~I'm in the red overall~~ Went back green today, buying more calls for earnings\n\nThey're also [selling some shares](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68561614) in alcohol companies  \n\nEven when PM beats expectations, their stock drops \n\n[I have Clinodactyly, a condition found in 3% of the regular population, but in 25% of those with down syndrome.](https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/clinodactyly#:~:text=Clinodactyly%20is%20the%20medical%20term,Down%20syndrome%20(trisomy%2021)) Let this one marinate \n\ntdlr; kids love nicotine, ZYN is the new craze, underage use will skyrocket $PM sales\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4/2 edits:\n-This isn’t going to actually hit $100, many people have pointed out why this is true.

We have Levi's earnings AH on Wednesday.\nRetail has been absolutely shitting the bed with their forecasted guidance- LULU, NKE, PVH to just name a few. OFC there will be some outliers. BUT LEVI'S WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM!!!\n\nLEVI's FY 2024 forecast they gave in Q4 2023 was: \n- Revenue growth of 1-3% (I backed these numbers out and not given in the report $6.24B-$6.36B)\n- EPS of $1.15-$1.25 (in actual report)\n\nLEVI's Q1 2024 Street expectations: \n- $1.53B in Revenue (YoY decline of 9.5%)\n- $0.20 in EPS (YoY decline of 41.2%)\nIn PYs with revenue around $1.5Bish, their EPS was higher with around $0.3-$0.4.\n\nSo, let me get this straight, for FY 2023, Levi's had revenue of $6.18B and adjusted EPS was $1.10. And for FY 2024, they expect higher revenue of $6.24B-$6.36B and higher EPS of $1.15-$1.25, but their Q1 (which includes holiday sales) go down massively YoY?? Is it just me or is the math not mathing? \n\nOne UBS analyst wrote \"We anticipate the company delivers a small 1Q 2024 beat and maintains its $1.15 to $1.25 fiscal 2024 EPS guidance. We expect this will have a slightly positive impact on sentiment, which skews moderately bearish.\" I agree that they will deliver a Q1 beat, BUTTTTTTTTTT I think they will lower guidance. \n\nAlso, the risk/ reward is much better in favor of puts compared to calls. The stock is up 25% YTD, 50% the past 6 months.\n\nTwo risks to consider\n1. Beyonce mentioned Levi's in her new album- articles indicating this will lead to an increase in sales, however, IDK if it will be reflected in their guidance, OFC, this is a risk\n2. I did check the short interest % float is a bit high at 11%ish, the stock could be squeezed higher with better than expected earnings or increased guidance.\n\nTLDR; Levi's going to give shit guidance, buying puts tmrw, IV is around 40-60%, so not too bad. Will post positions tmrw, but going to buy LEVI $20P, 5/17 and 7/19.",

        "text": "ACHR (Archer Aviation Inc) is a market leader in eVTOLs, which are essentially electric helicopters which are emission-free, quieter, safer, and more energy efficient (some designs have wings which allow them to glide). Since they're quieter and have no emissions, they have less restrictions in where permanent landing areas can be set up. Which is why United Airlines, US Air Force, the UAE, Blade (air taxi company), etc. are also investing in the technology.\n\n  \nNow let's compare the electrification of aviation with the electrification of cars. The only appeal EVs have is that their operating costs are lower (i.e. energy and maintenance) and that they're emission-free. Other than that, they're pretty much exactly like gas cars except they're also more expensive to buy. With eVTOLs, you get those perks out of the box. Combine that with the ability to build vertiports virtually anywhere, and you get an industry ready to boom. Not to mention that ACHR is diversified, so it'll manufacture eVTOLs as well as operate its own air taxi service. In fact, I'd say that ACHR has more upside potential now than TSLA did in 2012 because of this.\n\n  \nAt this point, you're probably accusing me of comparing apples to oranges because the markets are completely different (i.e. aviation vs passenger cars). This isn't your typical long-range jet aviation though. This is urban air mobility which has short to mid range applications (e.g. airport to downtown). As use cases widen, it'll actually start taking over share of the passenger car market since commuters will turn to eVTOLs as opposed to booking rideshare and/or owning/renting cars.\n\n  \nACHR's market cap is only $1B currently, but the helicopter market alone is valued at $50B. Imagine if it captures a good chunk of rideshare, gets a contract with Amazon, builds fully-autonomous flight, etc. It could easily become a 100x investment over the next 10 years.\n\n  \nPositions: $1,500 ACHR\n\nEDIT: From reading the comments, it looks like a lot of concern seems to be around FAA certification. Here is the FAA's stance on eVTOLs: https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis. The stock is dirt cheap right now because it's not fully FAA certified yet, but there's a clear path to certification so it's only a matter of time. Once the aircraft is fully certified, risk goes down, and price will go up.",

In an industry where guidance is critical to stock valuation, Carnival posted a record quarter in which it upped its yearly estimates for just about every metric.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Performance over the quarter was impressive](https://preview.redd.it/yxifvud04xrc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf5370671a5ff7609f74362c43443a44fff527a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Guidance was also increased](https://preview.redd.it/cazkp5i34xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e2c9169f6c5569d21905b881c4d09461db41a0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe same thing has occurred before during earnings - On June 26, 2023, Carnival had reported excellent guidance only for stock prices to see a substantial dip on earnings day (See links 1 and 2).\n\nHowever, after an 11% percent dip on June 26 to $14.60, the stock price rallied over 30% by July 5 to $19.10.

This is why I purchased OTM calls for this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wouldn't be the first time a rebound occurred so quickly after earnings](https://preview.redd.it/0segw61r4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eacc8592e4d9d610a9762f486236e02aea2ecf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDebt is large but managed well - Carnival is repaying debt faster than ever on its path to financial health, making roughly 8 billion dollars worth of repayments in the last 15 months, with most of it being ahead of schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Debt repayments have accelerated](https://preview.redd.it/4myl7tuu4xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3812705e41500a1a072a7ec4db065e9094aefe4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Company is massive and is finally recovering from COVID-19 :\n\nCarnival received analyst upgrades across the board after its recent earnings call. Analyst forecasts are not incredibly telling. Still, across reports in the last three months, Carnival has received a mean price target of 22.55, signifying a 37.5% increase in price from today. A healthy upward consensus is vital for a company rebounding like CCL (See link 3).\n\nCarnival has the most market share among passengers on any cruise line, so the hit from COVID-19 was unsurprising. Now, however, coronavirus is simply a distant memory for the tourism industry, with cruise demand at record highs.\n\nWhy I think the stock took a beating: If I’m being honest, I do not understand why the market’s reaction was so poor; it seems almost artificial. The only reason I can think of was the Baltimore bridge collapse, where a bridge at one of Carnival’s key ports collapsed. News broke out about this last Wednesday, which is the same as earnings, which could be why there was a 6% dip on Wednesday and Thursday combined. The bridge collapse, however, only constitutes about a $10 million hit to Carnival, which should be pretty insignificant to their bottom line.\n\nAt this point, Carnival shares are highly undervalued, to the extent that I decided to purchase 4dte otm calls, considering I see an imminent acute pickup in stock price.\n\n\\*This is not Financial advice\\*\n\nPosition:\n\n[Position is fairly optimistic, but i think the thesis is sound](https://preview.redd.it/soqd93mk4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b860ecc709beca6678602924fece0c9af8ee05e6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - buy undervalued cruise line stock; it about to go up; if you dumb-dumb and want to gamble like me, purchase short-term OTM calls\n\nWhy won't automod let me post is someone short this. Nvm, let me try removing links. Sources will be in the comments. ",

Zoetis is a medical company that makes vaccines and produces other measures to prevent the spread of animal diseases. Thread can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/5DEtyXYDLQ\n\nToday, the second EVER human case of the avian flu virus (bird flu) was just recorded in Texas: https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/texas-reports-human-case-of-avian-flu-virus-dshs-issues-health-alert/amp/. Guess where it came from? The same **cattle that was infected in Texas.** This is unprecedented since there has never been a case of this bird flu reported in humans in the US ever before now. \n\nHuman cases obviously lead to more interest for a vaccine and once news of this spreads, there will be imminent pressure to continue developing a vaccine. Zoetis has already been in the process of manufacturing a vaccine for the bird flu virus so I’m betting on them. The USDA has already granted Zoetis a license for preventing the same exact avian flu virus from infecting chickens: https://www.zoetisus.com/news-and-media/zoetis-receives-contract-award-to-supply-the-usdas-national-veterinary-stockpile\n\nZTS 180c 4/19",

        "text": "Fellow rate cut waiting regards, it’s the I TOLD YOU SO guy again. After being correct and right all of last year stating no recession or Pivot, I want to discuss the “Higher for Longer” scenario. The fact is interest rate is still extremely low based on historical measurements and norms. Here is the chart of US long-term rate dating back to 1790\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zce4chtqswrc1.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15b1fb12fc0b92615c61fed62ba000964e24b8d9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInflation is already picking back up albeit slowly. Service inflation has held steady while goods inflation is crawling back up. Energy and commodity prices are going back up as China is recovering and the US oil reserve needs to be replenished again. The US 10 year bond is at 4.32% but still down from October high. If you want to know why, please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeukdb/us_treasury_department_rigged_data_to_keep/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gp6heuouswrc1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b7f69ee877f7a9b709b95cc85c27aa24fb62876\n\nIn general, goods inflation will fluctuate over time. It goes up and down based on outsourcing, technology progression, and supply-demand dynamic. It is based on things you eat, wear, touch and feel and consumer goods generally depreciate over time. There are durable and nondurable goods and things lasting over 3 years are considered durable goods like cars, TVs, and refrigerators. While most goods are not considered essential (we can argue about gasoline but people own EVs too), they are good to have. So the prices generally have a ceiling as you can always stop buying goods if the prices spiral out of control. Service inflation is a different story and a different beast. These are prices you buy for Rent or airfare (even BJ behind the Wendy’s dumpsters) and are for services you received. You don't get to horde services like you do with good. Think toilet papers or water bottles during COVD Pandemic. The inflation action has been hot in services and this accounts for 66% of the CPI weighting. Services inflation for the most part sits in the category of ESSENTIAL as they are for things you MUST have to survive and you cannot horde them. Think utilities, hookers, or rent so prices cannot come down because you constantly need these services and they cannot easily be outsourced to China or some other shithole countries. The inflation in services remains hot and will not come down unless we have a severe recession which I do not predict we will have this year either.   \n\nSo how do you make money you ask? I got no f\\*\\*king idea, gold is at all-time record high along with stock, shitcoins, and real estate outside of shithole states like CA. However, I bet a crash may come sometime after the elections but I think it’s might be too early to buy puts.   ",

        "text": "Alright, first post fellow regards! My first DD is on Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA). Strap in and tuck in those Wendy’s napkins cause this baby is about to get wet 💦\n\nThere are only two key ingredients that are going into this centuries-old Dutch recipe. \n\n1. A gobsmackingly undervalued midstream oil company\n\n2. The best strategic tailwinds in the U.S. oil market since 1945\n\nCompany: TLDR: PAA is a midstream provider that transports and stores crude, natural gas, and other refined oil products. They make money primarily from the Frac Spread which presents a golden opportunity to dive in now. \n\n(more on this later)\n\nFinancials: Three points:\n\n1. Consistent revenue growth over the past three years, with total revenues increasing from $29.28 billion in 2021 to $33.14 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%.\n\n2. PAA has maintained strong profitability margins, with a gross margin of 17.8% and an operating margin of 9.6% in 2023. Through a complex macro-environment for midstream players \n\n3. Balance sheet has total assets of $34.72 billion and total liabilities of $21.84 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.08, indicating a reasonable level of leverage, especially given capital intensive Midstream business model.\n\nU.S. oil is about to have the decade of its life\n\n1. U.S. oil production is at record highs, due embargoes on Russian oil, and sanctions enacted by the Biden administration.\n\n2. Biden has his hands tied because in order to reduce inflation (fed looks at core) he needs to continue drilling— which will further position the U.S. to become a crucial and reliable supplier given extremely high geopolitical tensions.\n\n3. Trump re-election is seen as a potential wildcard, with expectations of heightened demand for oil and increased premiums, prompting strategic longterm investment to capitalize on market dynamics\n\nThe kicker (frac spread)\n1. Currently, oversupply in NG depresses its prices, while NGLs maintain better demand and higher prices. PAA benefits from this spread by purchasing NG-based NGLs at lower prices and selling them at higher NGL rates. The wider the spread, the greater PAA’s profit margin, making its operations more lucrative. Factors affecting the spread’s future include NG pipeline capacity and LNG export capacity. The ‘fatness’ of the frac spread depends on whether natural gas pipeline capacity can keep up with demand growth (IT CAN’T)\n\n1. My plan is to ride this up all year with weeklies and transition to synthetic calls once valuation becomes more rich. That said, calls are essentially FREE at current prices (especially further out you go) I’m deep in with April 19th calls @17.50 for 20c apiece \n \n ",

They did it by making some absolutely bonkers plays that were high risk and the majority of you smooth-brain fucks can't see.\n\nGoodluck and if you're so adamant on it being garbage, please short or buy puts -- otherwise, suck my chode.\n\n\n----\nOriginal post\n----\n\n\n**Financial Performance:**\nBlackBerry Ltd. ($BB) is on fire, and I mean a big ass dumpster fire. People say, \"Blazing a trail of growth and stability as it transforms from hardware to software and services\" which is hard to convince investors, or any other financial crowd, given their recent performance. Their latest quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $259 million, actually seeing a 10% increase YoY. The software and services revenue, now the core revenue driver, surged 17% YoY to $215 million, which is actually surprising for them. They have a debt/revenue ratio of .3 which is a good spot to be in for leveraging upcoming shifts in the financial space\n\n\n**Cybersecurity and IoT Focus:**\nBlackBerry's strategic pivot towards cybersecurity and IoT is the only reason they're not fucked. Everybody is fucking up your shit and Media keeps hyping the absurdness of scamming lately, and while that's FUD for my brain while I drink my coffee, organizations are doubling down on cybersecurity investments to bolster their traditional cyber-security backing. BlackBerry's cybersecurity offerings, including endpoint security, encryption, and threat detection, are positioned to ride this wave of demand. They have a good point to ride a wave on the regarded Boom of AI if they mention they are able to branch into new AI related protections. \n\nJust to be frank: In the IoT arena, BlackBerry ain't trash... and with the world being digitized more everyday, their market share is not capping out anytime soon.\n\n\n**Partnerships and Acquisitions:**\nBlackBerry isn't just playing the game; it's buttfucking the rules and generating a new set of Uno cards to pull out in a pinch. They've had a *few* strategic partnerships & acquisitions. BlackBerry is expanding its product portfolio and market reach. Their Alliance w/ Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop and market BlackBerry's intelligent vehicle data platform, IVY, is a integrated in every fucking car. Good luck getting the fuck away from IVY. Bitch'll make you itch. This partnership not only validates BlackBerry's technology but also opens doors to the lucrative automotive industry, a hotbed for IoT innovations. Their core partnerships include:\n\n\n***Partnerships***:\n**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: BlackBerry partnered with AWS to develop and market the BlackBerry IVY intelligent vehicle data platform, targeting the automotive industry.\n**Baidu**: BlackBerry partnered with Baidu to integrate its QNX technology into Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform, Apollo.\nAcquisitions:\n\n**Cylance**: In 2018, BlackBerry acquired Cylance, an artificial intelligence and cybersecurity company, to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities.\n**Good Technology**: BlackBerry acquired Good Technology, a provider of secure mobility solutions, in 2015, to strengthen its position in the enterprise mobility market.\n**WatchDox**: BlackBerry acquired WatchDox, a secure file-sharing company, in 2015, to enhance its enterprise security offerings.\n\n\n\n**Potential for Growth and Innovation:**\nLet's be real -- Blackberry is the gardener, floating face down in the pond while the big boys eat caviar, spoon fed by their advanced AI sex-bots. But, If that Gardener survives, the lawsuit to make sure that he doesn't disclose all the other wild shit they've seen at Steevie McQueefies house, well -- that'd be enough to float this bad boy right back into relevancy, *metaphorically of course*. At their current financial performance, strategic focus on cybersecurity and IoT, and partnerships with industry giants, BlackBerry is trying to prepare for upwards growth and innovation. As businesses prioritize digital transformation and security, BlackBerry stands poised to capture a lion's share of these burgeoning markets.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\nI mean -- we know what the fuck. They ain't been great the last decade: despite its recovering performance, intense competition in the cybersecurity and IoT markets *could* dampen its growth. Additionally, BlackBerry's fortunes are closely tied to the economic landscape, with fluctuations potentially impacting IT spending by businesses. That being said, These Canadians are going to be the nicest to work with, and will *likely* not spill poutine on your servers.\n\n**General Discussion**\nThe discussion around $BB upcoming quarterly report *seems* to be leaning towards a more bullish sentiment, likely due to several factors, including the company's shift towards software and services, which has always had promising growth. BlackBerry's partnerships and acquisitions in key areas like cybersecurity and IoT have positioned it well for future growth opportunities. Investors may be optimistic about the potential for BlackBerry to deliver strong financial results in the upcoming report, particularly in its software and services segments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, BlackBerry's transformation, strategic focus, and partnerships have set the stage for a potential journey of growth & innovation. With its current financial standing, competitive product portfolio, and market positioning, BlackBerry is a poised to make your portfolio like three fiddy. \n\nPosition: Shares and $4C for 04/05.\nIf everything goes to shit... well -- atleast I'll have a bag for her head later that night...",

As we approach Judgement Day, the AI takeover event, SKYNET's potential to dominate various industries becomes even more relevant. Whether it's autonomous vehicles, predictive analytics, or cybersecurity, SKYNET's advanced AI technology positions it as a leader in the tech revolution.\n\nDefense Contracts Pre-Judgement Day: Governments worldwide are ramping up defense spending in anticipation of potential threats, including the looming possibility of AI becoming self-aware. SKYNET's origins in military applications make it a prime candidate for securing lucrative defense contracts. As tensions escalate and nations prepare for the unknown, SKYNET could see a surge in demand for its cutting-edge technology.\n\nPost-Judgement Day Survival: Now, I know what you're thinking: \"But won't SKYNET lead to humanity's downfall?\" While the risks are certainly there, savvy investors know how to turn a potential apocalypse into profit. In a post-Judgement Day scenario, SKYNET's technology could be crucial for survival. Think about it – advanced AI for resource management, robotics for rebuilding infrastructure, and cybersecurity to fend off rogue machines. Investing in SKYNET now could position you for success in the aftermath of the apocalypse.\n\nSpace Exploration and Colonization: As humanity faces the prospect of extinction, the race to colonize other planets becomes more urgent. SKYNET's space exploration division could play a pivotal role in this endeavor. By investing in SKYNET, you're not just betting on Earth; you're betting on the future of humanity beyond our home planet.\n\nMeme Potential Pre and Post-Judgement Day: Let's not forget the meme potential here. The name SKYNET alone is enough to send the internet into a frenzy. Whether it's pre-Judgement Day hype or post-apocalyptic memes, SKYNET has the meme magic to drive retail investors wild. WallStreetBets would be all over this like flies on honey, sending SKYNET stock to the moon and beyond.\n\nSo, fellow degenerates, are you ready to embrace the chaos and invest in SKYNET? Judgement Day may be approaching, but with the right moves, we can turn the end of the world into tendie paradise. YOLO or bust!",

These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.\n\n- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I’m going to make a killing on the downfall.\n\nBull:\n\n- This is Donald Trump’s company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I’m gonna buy shares.\n\n- Donald Trump’s company just went public? This guy is the world’s #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I’m in.\n\n- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x\n\nLike everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed.\n\nSo why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don’t GAF camp, I’m just here to make money. Then here’s why it matters, the politics of this stock has created a massive short squeeze opportunity the likes we haven’t seen since the stock who shall not be named (... \"we like the stock\").\n\nLet’s take a look, starting with the most recent ORTEX data:\n\n[SI Overview](https://preview.redd.it/k1hn3qhqqvrc1.png?width=3584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7dbf15c7638766bc500d7d8f049bc133ac4a0d)\n\n1. the Short interest value is $278.73 million.\n2. the Cost to Borrow is at 342.71%.\n\nFor those who don’t follow this kind of thing, most stocks, especially those that are widely held and traded have a relatively low cost to borrow rate, often below 5%. Stocks that are in high demand for shorting, have limited availability, or are perceived as having higher risk may have significantly higher borrowing costs. Rates above 20% are generally considered high and indicate a particular set of circumstances that makes shorting those stocks more expensive. 290.65% annual borrowing cost is far outside the norm, It suggests an exceptionally high demand to short the stock, combined with a very limited supply of shares to borrow. Here’s where things get interesting…\n\nLet’s take a look at how much shorts are spending daily with these numbers:\n\n(SI \\* CTB) / days per year = cost per day.\n\n**($278,730,000 \\* 342.71%) / 365 = $2,617,083 per day the shorts are paying to borrow shares & short $DJT!**\n\nHow did shorts do lasts week with these high rates and high demand for $DJT?\n\n*Processing img 7rj9qlkubwrc1...*\n\nThey took a $95 million loss, lol!\n\nSo what are shorts doing now? Are they running for the hills? Are they declaring defeat?\n\n*Processing img anagfj98cwrc1...*\n\n\nNope… They’re doubling down. Last Thursday they borrowed over 879k shares at a borrow rate of \\~ 600+%!!!\n\nWhich brings up the question. What are the shorts betting on?\n\nIt’s simple, the shorts are betting that they can get shareholders to sell based off the fundamentals of $DJT. Is this company making money? Is it worth the current valuation? The answer is no and no one would hold after acquiring these gains, right?\n\nWhat they aren’t realizing here is Trump supporters are holding $DJT. The same people who after 2 impeachments, 4 indictments, Jan 6th, “Grab em’ by the p\\*\\*\\*\\*”, $DWAC SEC investigations, <insert random scandal here>, aren’t leaving his side. They are still buying his $400 shoes [for over $450,000](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-sneakers-ebay-profits-1872111), buying 110,000 of his [$100 “Trump baseball cards”](https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards), and more than anything, still voting for him. These people would march through the gates of hell for Trump and would die before selling their shares. The shorts are GROSSLY underestimating to what lengths these people will go for Donald Trump.\n\nThis brings us to the crux of the situation. The shorts need to keep the price down and are throwing the kitchen sink at it. If they can’t, they will be forced to cover 4.5 million shares worth at whatever price the holders deem their shares are worth. All this while it’s costing the shorts $2,617,083 dollars per day to keep this going & it costs $DJT holders nothing. It’s quite clear which side can outlast the other in this situation.\n\nThat’s all I have to share for now. I hold $DJT shares and options. Obviously the squeeze would become more likely if investors buy shares in addition to options. Feel free to double check and correct any of my info. Good luck to everyone no matter what side you fall on. Hopefully we all can make some money on this.\n\n",

        "title": "$CPRX Catalyst Pharmaceuticals Good Value",
        "text": "Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $CPRX is a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for rare neurological diseases. The company's flagship product, Firdapse (amifampridine), has received approval for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in the United States.\n\nMarket Potential: Catalyst Pharmaceuticals operates in a niche market focusing on rare neurological diseases. The prevalence of such diseases and the limited treatment options available present a significant market opportunity for the company.\n\nFDA Approval and Commercialization: Firdapse has been granted FDA approval for the treatment of LEMS, which provides Catalyst Pharmaceuticals with a competitive advantage in the market. The company has initiated commercialization efforts, indicating potential revenue growth in the foreseeable future.\n\nFinancial Performance: Reviewing Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' financial performance provides insights into its stability and growth potential. As of the last several quarterly reports, the company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth, with revenue increasing by 82% in the most recent. Additionally, the company has maintained a healthy cash position with free cash flow increasing YoY since 2019 and manageable debt levels that includes a cash-to-debt ratio of 38:1, indicating financial stability.\n\nDevelopment: Beyond Firdapse, Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has a promising pipeline of potential therapies targeting other rare neurological disorders. The advancement of these pipeline candidates could further diversify the company's revenue streams and strengthen its position in the market.\n\nInvestor Sentiment and Analyst Ratings: Monitoring investor sentiment and analyst ratings can provide additional insights into market expectations and potential price movements. Analyzing recent trends in analyst coverage and consensus price targets can help assess the stock's perceived value by market professionals.\n\nFinancial Data Support:\n\nRevenue Growth: Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has consistently reported revenue growth over the past few years, +16.3% 2020, +18.2% 2021, +52.1% 2022, and +85.9% 2023, indicating strong demand for its products. The company's revenue for the last reported quarter was $398.2 million, representing roughly an 82% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nProfitability: Conducting a profitability analysis can provide insights into the company's ability to generate profits from its operations. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has reported positive net income in recent quarters, reflecting its ability to effectively manage costs and generate returns for shareholders. EBITDA is an alternate measure of profitability to net income, and it can be a useful way to measure how efficiently a company is operating. Analyzing $CPRX’s last three years, when compared to the previous, you will see the company is operating efficiently: +27% 202, +96% 2022, +16.1% 2023\n\nBalance Sheet Strength: Examining Catalyst Pharmaceuticals' balance sheet can assess its financial health and liquidity position. As of the last reported quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $137.6 million and total debt of $3.5 million. The company's healthy cash position and manageable debt levels indicate financial stability and flexibility to support its growth initiatives.\n\nCash Flow Analysis: Analyzing the company's cash flow statement can provide insights into its ability to generate cash from its core operations, invest in growth opportunities, and return value to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals has maintained positive operating cash flow, with the most previous quarter reflecting $61.8 million in free cash flow and last three annual reports reflecting YoY increase of +59.3% 2021, +116% 2022, +61.8% 2023, demonstrating its ability to generate cash from its business activities.\n\nEarnings Call: While three of the last four earnings calls have been consensus misses, each earnings call has improved from the previous with the most recent earnings call a beat. The next earning call is scheduled for May 8th.  \n\n\nEdit:\n\nPosition $CPRX 17.5c 5/17/24",

Not financial advice assuming you degens will do detailed research\n\n**Downside:**\n\n* Stock is heavily shorted and targets by shorts. SI is 76%\n* It is shorted to shits for a reason. Company is accused of fraud, linked to a known fraudster Kahn and is super delayed on its 10K, a red flag. Clearly it is not all roses\n* Real chance this can go to zero if company never submits a 10k or changes their numbers materially\n\n**Why did I still YOLO**\n\n* Well this sub is not called valuw investing. Taking Bets is part of the game and risk\n* Fair value of this company is $50-70. It was around this price before the shorts attacked them. Currently It is at $21\n* Few positive catalysts in the last few weeks\n* While company is delayed in it’s 10k it clearly said they don’t expect any material changes to its numbers\n* Filing last week stating they have agreed to an extension with their lenders and will submit the audited 10k report latest by April 29th. So now we have a clear deadline\n* The above two are both in their public filing\n* Well SI is 76%, one of the highest in the market, if things come out clean, a squeeze can be a real bonus here and short term who knows what happens. Again, this all depends on the 10K. But currently no shares to borrow, CTB 90% and Utilization 99%.\n\n**TLDR** – Company accused of fraud, shorted to shits , can go to zero, but trading well below fair value, can easily spike up on audited clean financials and a squeeze can be a bonus.\n\nPutting my money where my mouth is but maybe see you behind Wendy’s in July\n\nManage your risk!\n\nEdit 1: The OI on April 19 20c jumped from 5k to 7k while puts dropped from 13k to 10k.

I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. \n\nBut here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. \n\nI wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I’m relieved I’m out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. 🚀💰🤑\n\nTLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days.",

The software is used by over 1,750 banks and credit unions including TD bank, Truist, Santander bank, and Barclays. \n\nnCino reported earnings last week. The expected EPS was .12 cents per share. It almost doubled the expected EPS with .21 cents per share. EPS has risen for the past 5 quarters from .03 per share 5 quarters ago to the recent .21 cents per share. After reporting earnings the stock went up about 20%. Future guidance is .55 cents per share. It has consistently risen all last week and I think it will continue to rise because the recent earnings deserve a 50%+ rise in share price. Before the blowout earnings it traded around $30 a share. As of Friday it is $37 a share. I think it can get to around $50 a share by May. \n\nThis company is profitable and growing rapidly. It is a candidate to be bought out by other cloud companies or a big banking player.  \n\nOptions are relatively cheap. I have some May, August, and September calls. I also have about 1000 shares.

        "title": "TKO - Owning  UFC and WWE could net you a FCF yield of 7-9%",
        "text": "First DD I’m posting here.  Hope you benefit from it.  As a warning it will be mostly point form.  We’re all busy you don’t have time to read filler words and I don’t care to write them.  Also posting on Easter Weekend so you can say you’re “working” and read this instead of spending time with relatives.  Here goes. \n\nTKO group describes themselves as a premium sports and entertainment company that comprises the UFC and WWE.   \n\nOn September 12, 2023 Endeavour group (the then owner of UFC) and WWE closed a transaction to combine the two entities to form a new, publicly listed company (TKO group holdings).  Endeavour Group Holding (also publicly traded btw) remains majority shareholder with 51% of outstanding shares. \n\nUnfortunately, there is not much data that I could find on the combined group.  Financials that I found cover only January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023 for UFC and September 12, 2023 – December 31, 2023 for the combined WWE and UFC.  Parent financials for are available for through Endeavour Group Holdings dating back only to 2021.  WWE financial reports are available back to 2000 as it was a separate publicly traded company.\n\nHistory:\nBoth the UFC and WWE are household names and represent the most well recognized franchises in combat sports and wrestling entertainment respectively.  Additionally, both companies have long operating histories.  For reference the UFC just celebrated its 30th anniversary having hosted its first fight in 1993 and will be celebrating the UFC 300 event this coming April.  The WWE dates back even further, tracing its origins back to the 1950s being founded by either the father or grandfather of the well-known (and now somewhat infamous) figurehead Vince McMahon according to Wikipedia. \n\nAbout the business:\nUnder the new combined company the UFC and WWE will operate us separate entities.  The UFC will led by Dana White, who has served as president of the UFC since 2001 and grown it to a multibillion dollar business.  The WWE being led by Nick Kahn who joined the  WWE in 2020 and took over the role of President in 2021.\n\nPer their 10K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 TKO group generates revenue from principal activities:\n\n1. Media rights and content.\n2. Live events.\n3. Sponsorship.\n4. Consumer products licensing.\n\n1. Media and content:\nTKO generates revenue from licensing live events and original programming to broadcasters domestically and internationally that carry TKO programming on digital and linear channels as well as pay-per-view.\n\nThese contracts last 3–5 years with broadcasters but they have some significant agreements lasting 7–10 years.\n\nBroadcasters that have contracts with WWE or UFC include: ESPN, ABC, Comcast, Fox, Peacock, Tencent, Sony, Warner Brothers and now Netflix. \n\nProgramming includes long and short for content, reality, series, and other filmed entertainment. Furthermore, TKO not only sells to distributors but also sells direct to consumers through UFC fight pass and WWE network.\n\n2. Live events:\nLive events generate revenue generation through ticket sales, site, fees, travel packages, and VIP experiences.\n\nBetween WWE and UFC generate 350 annual live events per year\n\n3. Sponsorships:\nTKO generates ad revenue and sponsorship revenue from sale of in-venue and in broadcasting advertising assets and digital impressions.\n\nAd revenues are driven by original content on third party social media platforms. For example, WWE has 100 million subscribers on YouTube and is the 12th most followed channel.\n\nTKO group also has partnerships with major brands, including Anheuser-Busch, Draft Kings, GM, P&G, Monster Energy, Wendy’s, Toyo tires and others.\n\n4. Consumer product licensing:\nTKO group merchandises a broad, portfolio of products, including video games, trading cards, apparel, memorabilia, equipment, toys, and digital goods. This is done mostly through royalties and licensing fees, through sales of branded products and event sales as well as via e-commerce platforms. The largest sales items here are video games and toys. There are agreements with EA sports for UFC and Take Two for WWE for video game franchises.  Additionally, there are agreements with Mattel to produce toys.\n\nWhy invest?: \n1. Synergies- I believe there are synergies to be had between UFC and WWE in terms of securing media rights and sponsorships.  Further, Endeavour Group Holdings  as a majority shareholder with their talent management and online sports betting businesses is likely to be a motivated co-owner in furthering promotion of these two business brands. \n\n2. There are significant tailwinds to content provision.  Sponsors are projected to increase their spending  on live sports and entertainment advertising at a 9% CAGR over the next two years.  Streaming providers (Netflix, Amazon, Apple) are also expected to increase their spend by CAGR’s reaching the mid 20% range.  With the competition between streaming services heating up there is likely to be competition for sought after quality content such as the programming provided by WWE and UFC.\n\n3. Mixed martial arts (MMA)  is growing rapidly in popularity with the UFC easily being the most recognized franchise in MMA. For example, it is reported that sports betting on UFC is the largest growing segment in the sports betting industry.  With rising popularity of their broadcasts they may be able to increase the pricing of ad placement. \n\nRisks:\n1. WWE CEO Vince McMahon’s recent departure leads to less certainty with leadership, however, given the recent scandals surrounding him this may be more positive than negative for the WWE side of the business but the impact of this remains to be seen.\n\n2. While WWE’s revenue has grown substantially over the past decade, growth has slowed and I don’t envision as much growth in this aspect of the combined business. \n\n3. It is possible that UFC’s growth could be hampered by increased competition from other combat sports / franchises including boxing, K1 kickboxing, Combat karate, and One Champ.  For the foreseeable future, however, UFC is clearly the dominant player in MMA.  \n\nValuation:\nValuation is somewhat difficult given the paucity of available information, however, management has provided 2024 FY guidance in their most recent report and are targeting a free cash flow conversion of greater than 50% with EBITDA in range of $1.15–1.17 billion.  From: https://investor.tkogrp.com/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/TKO_4Q23-Earnings-Release_2-27-24_FINAL.pdf\n\nNow IF management performs as they predict for their 2024 full year guidance this would give an estimated free cash flow of $558 million at 50% FCF conversion of $1.15 billion EBITDA on the lower end of estimates to $644 million at a FCF conversion of 55% on $1.17 billion EBITDA on the upper end.\n\nGiven a market cap of $7.064 billion (as of March 28, 2024) this translates into a FCF yield of 7.90% at the low end of estimates and 9.12% at the upper end of estimates.  \n\nAlso, Goldman Sachs recently initiated coverage at a buy with a price target of $102. \n\nAll in all not a bad return IMO for owning two of the most dominant names in their respective domains.\n\nDisclosure: Long TKO\n\nSources: \n1.

The long USD vs short Yen carry trade was reborn. Why settle for just selling volatility and riding the crypto/tech wave upwards when you can get even more return by borrowing at low interest rates in Japan. After all, that's never ended badly for anyone. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghjnx81xknrc1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2577df97ae4910114fb2f13b246d1b9b30b0fb\n\nIn late 2023 it started to look like this party might be coming to an end, the market was frothing over 6-7 US rate cuts, and the BoJ was making murmurs about ending it's zero interest rate policy. \n\nAt the start of 2024 the headlines were expecting a possible BoJ rate hike in April 2024 ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/01/11/economy/boj-ex-official-on-ending-negtive-rate/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/01/11/economy/boj-ex-official-on-ending-negtive-rate/)). I don't remember reading a single article that was expecting a rapid pace of hikes, as per this quote from that link, \"The BOJ will only go slowly. It’s completely different from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, Sakurai said. What Japan’s economy needs is the continuation of an appropriate level of monetary easing.\"\n\nWe duly got a tiny BoJ rate hike in March and the FED has remained dovish, indicating that it still wants to cut rates in the face of high employment and slightly elevated inflation. Interest rate differentials fell. Of course the yen rallied right? Right? \n\nNo, the widow maker did what it does best and the Yen returned to freefall. How does the MSM explain this? \"The slide comes amid speculation the yen will remain under pressure to weaken due to Japan’s large yield discount to other developed economies, notably the US. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and his officials’ insisted that financial conditions will stay loose even though the nation hiked its interest rates for the first time since 2007 and scrapped the yield-curve control regime this week. [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/yen-falls-lowest-since-2008-010208156.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/yen-falls-lowest-since-2008-010208156.html)\". WTF? **Nobody** was ever expecting massive/rapid tightening in the first place.\n\nEveryone loves a good carry trade though, fundamentals be damned. So the hedgies, trend followers, retail etc. have continued to short the shit out of JPY. You can see this for yourself... [https://uk.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-jpy-speculative-positions-1614](https://uk.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-jpy-speculative-positions-1614)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l76vva4xonrc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=443d6a559de90f0ba43c1328f853a3eaac366872\n\nI for one am ignoring the BS coming out of the press, and think there is a decent chance that this carry trade gets unwound if/when the FED does start to cut rates. \n\nThink I am crazy?\n\nHere's an article in the HedgeFundJournal from May 2007 explaining why the Yen carry trade will probably continue to work, [https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-carry-trade/](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-carry-trade/). \"The situation is very different now. The excesses of the bubble 1980s have worked through the Japanese economic system. Hedge funds employ less leverage and big currency bets are much rarer. Many investors other than hedge funds are making use of cheap yen. Most transactions do not have to be unwound or can be hedged. Prime brokers and banks have become a little more disciplined about how much and to whom they provide leverage. The increased sophistication and institutionalisation of the hedge fund industry has brought focus to risk-adjusted returns not just top line performance. The carry trade is just one source of alpha among many. And why would Japan stop lending yen now? Japan has lots of money and the economy is much more stable than ten years ago. The carry trade is not without risk but then nothing is.\".\n\nWell, we have the luxury of knowing what happened next... the FED cut rates in late 2007 (shown below) and the dollar subsequently puked. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oyjxdmnpnrc1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb697265fa86b1cad34f41d9691848def16abb5\n\nHistory doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. Occam's razor. The increase in US vs Japan interest rates seemingly caused the recent selloff in the Yen, why wouldn't a decrease cause the opposite. \n\nThis all relies on the FED cutting rates, which might not happen, but I've started buying some JPY. Fancy joining me, and taking the other side of these momentum junkie, carry loving, short volatility investors before the fun starts?\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Daily queries growth of 63% and 131% Net Revenue Retention (NRR) at the low end of the (non AI) cycle show just how much they sandbagged guidance of 22%. Both lead to future revenue growth. For comparison, they just achieved 36% annual revenue growth with daily queries growth of 73% and 158% NRR as the cycle was trending down. Now the cycle is about to trend up. I'd be surprised if revenue growth is lower than 27% this year.\n\nThe new CEO Sridhar Ramasway is better than Slootman in every way. Slootman was a has-been-MBA-suit cashing in on his cachet like John Chen at BlackBerry. Took extreme stock based comp for himself and kept selling shares nonstop, while not keeping up with industry competition. Tech expertise is essential for tech CEOs to lead their companies to a monopolistic outcome. Research on the economics of tires (Slootman), not so much.\n\nThe company is about to become relevant in the AI space due to this change in leadership. And web services companies are probably the biggest long term beneficiaries of AI. They have better economics (network, scale, incremental capital requirements). The new CEO expects several new product launches this year and he delivered one [yesterday](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/unlock-insights-with-snowflake-data-clean-rooms/). That's impressive after a little over one month on the job.\n\nBy now everyone knows the CEO bought $5m worth of shares as part of his compensation contract this week. However, what's actually more interesting is Mark D. McLaughlin bought $501k worth of stock above $165 this month without being required to do so as part of any agreement. He similarly added $300k early last year at a higher price. He's a director of Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks, and Chairman of Qualcomm. Definitely the kind of guy who has his finger on the pulse of the tech scene. So if he's buying more this year than last year at the same price, he is more confident in the company's future now.\n\nFor all the programmers who argue that Snowflake is overpriced vs Redshift, Synapse, etc. and how it is far behind Databricks, please read:\n\n1. [This technical merit comparison on Snowflake vs Databricks](https://twitter.com/convequity/status/1773722517330653337?s=19/).\n2. [This comment about Snowflake vs Synapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/11ybe2d/comment/jd78ksl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3/)\n3. [This comment from a couple years ago about how pros misused Snowflake and ended up spending too much](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQLServer/comments/ww2zbc/comment/ilk2aq7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3/). My guess is that part of the decline in Net Revenue Retention and Revenue growth rates are partially due to this factor - people optimizing their use of the product for its true intent. The optimized processes still run on Snowflake after all. And there is more data and activity on Snowflake now. Most revenue is optimized, so the impact of that optimization wave on NRR diminishes. NRR rises again and converts $5.2 billion Remaining Purchase Obligations to revenue faster.\n4. Redshift is a dumpster fire according to many sources. [Like this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12mw1yy/redshift_vs_snowflake//)\n\nThese factors mean Snowflake growth will start to reaccelerate this year. The non-AI tech cycle is about to reaccelerate naturally. Snowflake is about to become more product innovation oriented. That  product innovation will turn its sails to catch the AI wind. They were misunderstood by customers. So they experienced less rapid growth as a result of those customers figuring out how to use the service more effectively. The changes the company made to better compete with Databricks are effective whereas Databricks' attempt to copy Snowflake are nascent in comparison. As more people begin to understand this setup, Snowflake will go back over $400 by next year. Therefore, Snowflake selloff seems like it is a temporary accident.\n\nPosition: 142 x $165c 4/19 exp (check profile for proof post).\n\nEdit: I also found this update on the AI work at $snow from one of its top engineers:\nhttps://twitter.com/rajhans_samdani/status/1770903641630863646?s=19\n\nImpressive that they beat gpt-4 by a good margin when combined with Mistral. And they surpassed everyone but gpt-4 as a standalone.\n\nAlso here's a total cost of ownership post on Databricks vs Snowflake:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/moazzam0/s/DDDNMXDKKo\n\nSnowflake AI head pointed out that Databricks cherry picked outdated metrics from 2019 to measure their model's performance.

And they have an expected revenue for next quarter at 8.98 billion. LIKE WHAT TF. \n\n2. They legit cannot make enough products to meet demand. Obesity and diabetes have swept the country and health related problems that LLY capitalize on have spiked and almost half of Americans are over weight and will soon need these drugs. Idk if you may have read that correctly. ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS ARE OVERWEIGHT, many also have diabetes which is also another area for lly to make money. \n\n3. Weight loss drugs are the temporary solution to this shitty problem. People will take the temporary solution any day of the week. And in this case the temporary solution is LLY weight loss drugs. \n\nThis is a powerhouse of a company with great financials and calls are definitely the play since earnings are later in April.

        "title": "Bullish or Bearish Powell Interview?",
        "text": "I have seen a pretty equal amount of people making the case that Powell's recent interview was bullish or bearish. I have decided to lay out the cases for both.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that PCE numbers were released a few hours before the interview. The numbers were in line with what was expected, with MoM PCE below expectations.\n\nDisclaimer: I saw Powell's comments as more dovish than hawkish, but I will try to lay out both cases as unbiasedly as possible.\n\n**Bullish perspective:**\n\nThe PCE numbers were a positive, in spite of a slight uptick, because they were what economists were expecting. Powell even alluded to that in the beginning of the interview, saying \"It is good to see something coming in line with expectations\" and \"It's definitely more along the lines of what we want to see\". He also mentioned a few times how inflation has been coming down and there has been real progress made.\n\nAt one point during the interview, the interviewer (who, by the way, was extremely brash) asked why would it be terrible to initially lower the rates before data provides confidence and react appropriately if the data changes. To which Powell said \"you're right, we always have to be humble,..The outlook is always much more uncertain than most people think\". He went on to say they (the Fed) are in a good place to react to a range of scenarios, with the bear case being holding rates where they are and the base case of lowering rates.\n\nMoreover, after the PCE release and interview, interest rate traders increased the odds of a June rate cut to ~60% from ~50% on Thursday.\n\n\n**Bearish:**\n\nPowell brought up the high inflation readings from January and alluded to them being concerning. He mentioned how they expect to see inflation coming down on bumpy path \n\nPowell also addressed the elephant in the room about when it is appropriate to begin lowering rates. He said \"we don't see it as likely to be appropriate to begin reducing interest rate until we are confident that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustained basis\". He reiterated multiple times that they are not in a hurry to lower rates. The reasoning behind this is that the economy is strong and unemployment is near historic lows. The case being made from bears is that this is a bad thing because it gives justification to the Fed to just keep rates where they are.\n\nLastly, Powell said that he does not see rates going back to their pre-pandemic low.\n\n\n**Why I am leaning bullish:**\n\nI don't think the markets expected Powell to cut rates in May anyways. So there was no expectation to rush into a rate cut. Also, I don't believe markets expected rates to go back to those below 1% pre pandemic lows.\n\nMy takeaway was that the worst case scenario is rates stay where they are for longer than expected, where best case scenario is they come down significantly. But even in that worst case scenario, it only happens because the economy is booming and unemployment stays low, so is it really worst case? Even in this worst case scenario, Powell alluded that eventually they would lower rates when inflation does come down. So there is no case where rates remain where they are indefinitely.\n\nTLDR: Bulls have a point, bears have a point, and I identify as a heterosexual bull (he/him pronouns).\n\n",

        "text": "## Powell's Tech Revolution: A clear signal in a sea of economic quicksand\n\nAlright folks, let’s dive deep without the fluff. Jerome Powell just lit up the stage with insights that resonate with anyone who’s spent more than a minute dissecting the intertwining of tech and economic fate. This isn’t about piecing together fragmented insights; it’s a panoramic view, and Powell’s holding the lens.\n\n**No Beating Around the Bush - Here’s What Powell Laid Out:**\n\n**Economic Resilience**: The U.S. economy? It’s on steroids, showing a kind of bounce-back that's nothing short of legendary. Powell isn't just tipping his hat; he’s underlining the brute strength that’s propelling us into tomorrow.\n\n**Inflation’s Tightrope**: Inflation's that annoying itch you can’t scratch away. Watching Powell navigate this is akin to seeing a tightrope walker juggling fire. He’s crafting a master plan to keep the economy's heat just right - warm enough for growth but cool enough to dodge a burn.\n\n**The New Work Order**: Gone are the days of the 9-5 grind being the norm. Remote work and the gig economy are shaking the foundations, and Powell's eyes are wide open to these seismic shifts reshaping the job landscape.\n\n**A World Tied Together**: Our economic destiny isn’t just ours to write; the global stage plays a pivotal role. Powell’s gaze extends beyond our borders, recognizing that our economic ship sails on international waters.\n\n**Anchoring Stability**: Amidst the storm, financial stability remains the North Star. Powell and his band are all hands on deck, ensuring the financial system stays robust, serving as the economy's backbone.\n\n## The Tech Juggernaut Takes the Wheel\n\nHere’s the kicker, the moment Powell dropped a truth bomb that should have everyone perked up: **\"OK. The things that matter for the United States economy over the medium and longer term are not the decisions the Fed makes... It’s the evolution of technology.\"** This isn’t just a nod to the tech scene; it’s an all-out declaration that tech - with AI, ML, and NLP leading the charge - is reshaping our economic reality right before our eyes.\n\nThis revolution isn’t about adding a new gadget to the lineup. It’s transforming how we deal with health crises, revolutionizing transport, and overhauling communication. If you’ve been giving the side-eye to the tech market’s wild ride, chalking it up to a “bubble,” Powell’s laying down the law: We're in the midst of a tectonic shift, with technology at the steering wheel of our economic future.\n\n## To Those Riding the Wave and the Skeptics on Shore\n\nFor the crowd that’s been knee-deep in economic models and tech breakthroughs, Powell’s message is more than a pat on the back—it’s a blaring siren. We’re at the crossroads of policy and pioneering technology, staring down a future laden with opportunities yet riddled with landmines.\n\nThis isn’t about hunting the next unicorn in a Silicon Valley gold rush, or the next earning calls of our favorite tech company. It’s about recognizing we’re part of a broader narrative, one where technology isn’t merely a player; it’s the playmaker.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Don't mistake this for financial advice. Consider this a heads-up, a nudge to recognize the monumental shifts Powell's spotlighting. Always, always make your moves based on your own DD /  Research and sound judgment.\n\nSo, what's the real talk here? If you’ve been banking on tech’s role in our economic evolution, Powell’s insights aren’t just validation—they're a resounding affirmation. We’re not just spectators in this digital age; we’re in the midst of an economic renaissance, with technology as our sculptor. And if you haven’t already doubled down on understanding this dynamic, now’s the time. Because in this economic quicksand, Powell’s words are the solid ground we’ve been searching for.\n\n[Link: Fed Chair Powell](https://www.marketplace.org/2024/03/29/fed-chair-powell-inflation-economy-interest-rates-monetary-policy-federal-reserve/)",

After this, I started making riskier bets to win those unrealized gains back, and now im down 60%. I now realize this was stupid gambling.\n\nI am starting to think the options trading I see here is not the best way. Here is my other idea. Let me know what you think.\n\nFind a momentum stock like [$VRT](https://ibb.co/MNfJS1j) that you think will continue ripping upward. If you don't like this stock, fine, pick a different one. Buy 100 shares. Then, buy 1 put ATM with an expiration date somewhat far enough in the future, 3-6-9 months. Now, normally when I buy a momentum stock, it tanks mercilessly as soon as I buy it. But this time I have a put, so my losses are limited to the cost of the put. If my long stock postion gains more than the cost of the put, I make sweet profit. If it tanks, I exercise my put, and turn the put writer into a WSB bagholder. Obviously this will only deliver big gains if the stock continues on its parabolic trajectory, but if it doesn't, my losses are limited.\n\nFor this stock, the 112 day put is about 10% of the share price, but the stock has been gaining more than 10% over that previous time period. \n\nHas anyone ever thought of this before? Am I regarded? Do people do this?\n\n",

A few things I believe to kick things off: (1) There are few golden / universal rules in gambling, and screenshot to close is not one of them lol. (2) I don't know everything, and it's awesome. I've been riding this stock since Q2 2023, switched to options late 23, then went even harder into options early 24. I'm long on the intrinsic value of the company, so I put my money where my mouth is.\n\nHere's my DD:\n\n* Last quarter RH reported profits to the surprise of the entire market who projected them losing money (beat expectations by 21x in some instances). Half of revenue came from interest earnings, which again, was to the surprise of Wall Street bc ppl still see this as a meme company that only makes money from regarded option plays, like mine. Read any article and few point this out.\n* Revenue is diversifying and assets under management is spiking. The high interest rate environment promotes this trend. RH offers high-yield 5% checking accounts. Just park your money there and you earn, and they earn from the arbitrage. Banks are ripping millions of ppl off with .025% savings rates, so I see a lot of growth opportunities here. IDK why laymen don't understand that FDIC secured means FDIC secured, regardless of the institution/bank holding the bag.\n* RH announced credit card and to no surprise, Wall Street is still offsides here, because no one is reporting on the innovation being built in partnership with VISA, THE VISA. Here's the quick summary: RH credit cards will allow you to create / destroy unlimited virtual cards, so you can sign up to unlimited free trials, gym memberships, etc and cancel the virtual card if the service provider is lame or gets pesky.\n* I totally respect r/wsb, but you regarded dudes still hate this company for the wrong reasons. They did not collude with citadel. Pls pls pls watch this episode of All in podcast where the hosts try to grill Vlad the Impaler: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HopEdff0RCU). If you hate Robinhood, at least hate it for the right reason: the company simply grew too fast, that's it, nothing malicious.\n* The gravy train has room to run because institutions like VC and PE equity are holding this since IPO, they will not sell until they are at least at IPO price in my regarded opinion. And because this company is building a strong mix of genuinely useful and valuable financial products for the masses in US and a bit abroad in UK.\n* Here's their mix of financial products for non-regards: (1) Retirement IRA with 1% match (this is revolutionary, but no one will say it), (2) high yield checking account 5% with RH gold, (3) Gold credit card with 3% back on all categories and 5% on travel with their travel platform.\n* Last but not least, $HOOD has a compelling and addicting platform for all of us gamblers. Do you all seriously believe this insane bull run of stocks, options, bonds, and crypto will not show up on Robinhood's next earnings? Literally everything under the sun is up 200%.\n\nNo speculation at all here, right, naked options are completely safe right?? Lol jk jk. My position is still open and I'm bullish on long-term intrinsic value. I can elaborate on these bullets, so please roast me in the comments. Also want to add that I've been taking screenshots and sharing with friends and fam for a few months to try to reverse the pattern so I can buy in lower, but it's not working. Hopefully this screenshot, that appears to be my first to wsb, will help ;)\n\nAlso, I expect a few smaller leaps upward, especially if they continue publishing monthly metrics. I also expect next earnings in may to be blockbuster. My ultimate price target is $40 by 2026. I see nothing keeping this stock and company from reclaiming its IPO price and above in two years.\n\nYours truly  \nFellow Regard,\n\nPosition as of this week - let me know if y'all want the average costs for each contract.\n\n[The all time chart is misleading bc I've withdrawn and deposited 2\\~3 times over the past 5 years.

The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named \"Stargate.\" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases. \n\nLINK:\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-planning-$100-billion-data-center-project-the-information-reports](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-planning-$100-billion-data-center-project-the-information-reports) ",

Recently this week alone I deposited in about $800 SGD = $550ish USD on Tuesday and managed to get it to about $1500 USD which I'm insanely proud off.\n\nWhen next Monday opens, I was initally thinking of shorting NVDA as I still believed its overpriced and might come down a lot, but recently I meant in the last 10 mins, I looked through 2023's Start of Q2, Q3 and Q4 and NVDA shot up a lot in the first day, as my strategy for options is no matter how long the DTE is i'll preferably sell the option on the same day to ensure theta dont ruin me.\n\nSo since only the only option that is avaible within my budget is a 1 week option of $1500 USD (Strike price of $910 current stock price is $902), y'all reckon following the trend is a good strategy as I predict that there will still be a sell off in the beginning then a $20 gain (Hopefully)\n\nI know that this will essentially be my entire portfolio so fuck it right, im still young and my Finance teacher's been doubting my abilities to make a 10 baggers gotta prove him WRONG!!!\n\nSo a $20 gain in NVDA if i get a good entry price this will likely give me a 3.5x of my $1500, i'm not rich by any metrics and if done properly I'll donate $100 to the old people playing harmonica and selling tissues by the train stations promise, to the moon we GO!?!?!?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amsbimsnebrc1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8e1f0ca27d62a1e2996a2affb4b21edc8035357",

On March 29, we only just now see February's PCE, but it is the end of March, and that subsequent report will already be just about finished. Institutions get to see those numbers weeks before us.\n\nHere's your proof:\n\nFrom July 28, 2023 through October 27, 2023, SPY dropped -$40.\n\nFrom June 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, PCE stopped declining and ramped up hot at 3.198% to 3.37% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))\n\nKeep those dates in mind, and follow along with daddy:\n\nFrom May 2023 through June 2023, PCE DROPPED 3.96% to 3.19%. The June DROPPED PCE rate would have released to the public on July 28, 2023. This is precisely when SPY began bleeding out. At that time the bleeding began, it would have looked to Retail as though PCE was still cooling. However, at the time June PCE was being released to the public, July data was already in existence, and the July data was going to show that PCE was no longer cooling, and in fact was rising again.\n\nYou still with me? Let's fast-forward to the most recent climb, which began on October 26, 2023, which has preceded this most recent vertical line up.\n\nOn October 27, 2023, Retail was just getting the released September PCE readings. ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01))\n\nAs you may recall, September's PCE readings were STILL GOING UP. On October 27, 2023, the public would still be seeing a rise in PCE. However, weirdly, the market began shooting up.\n\nGuess why...\n\nBecause the October data showed PCE significantly cooled from 3.37% to 2.95% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))\n\nWeirdly, this cooling data from October was not available to the public until November 30, 2023, at which point SPY had already rebounded from $410 to $450.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all. This isn't a conspiracy you clowns, this is real.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr, SPY price movements correlate perfectly with UNRELEASED PCE data, and contradicts the released data.\n\n&#x200B;",

Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  \n\nAAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.\n\nThe whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.\n\nThis whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.\n\nTLDR: June $175 calls",

        "title": "$DJT: The Play Has Only Just Begun",
        "text": "ATTENTION ALL REGARDS:\n\nThis DD is a continuation of the DJT play that was initially proposed in this post: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). (For the record, this is not a post just to pump my bags. I realized \\~$7,500 on last week's move and have initiated new positions. I legitimately think this thing has a lot more room to run, particularly because that's the exact opposite of what everyone is expecting).\n\nThe thesis was sound:\n\n1. A low float stock that can move significantly if volume comes in\n2. A merger and a ticker change to generate media coverage and bring the volume in\n3. A cult-like following with a track record of pouring their money into Donnie T related opportunities\n\nThe issue with this was the fixation on the 500 bagger. While DJT certainly could have tested it's ATH at $190 before 3/28, that was obviously not a likely outcome, especially when everyone was betting on it.\n\nWhile, unfortunately the 500 bagger didn't play out, there is still good news. The move that we did get has now primed this stock for a perfect setup, potentially plowing through $80 and toward the $190 ATH. Longs are moping around with their worthless calls talking about how it was a \"good ride\" and shorts are already bragging about the easy tendies they are going to make from fading this POS company into oblivion.\n\nThe consensus is now that the play is dead in the water which is why this is the perfect opportunity to take the opposite side.\n\nHEAR ME OUT:\n\n1. Be patient with the MAGA crowd. The snail mail that boomers have been writing to their financial advisors instructing them to smash the fucking bid on DJT isn't going to arrive until next week. The blue-collar crew have been wanting to pile in but are still waiting on their bi-weekly pay check to hit. Give them time. They are a little slower moving than us degen gamblers, but rest assured, they are still making their way to the party.\n2. This stock is majorly short-biased now. Borrow rate now at 600%: [(link to post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bqk2av/djt_short_borrow_rate_at_600/). Everyone is just assuming that this is a layup short and that Trump will dump his stock soon which is unlikely in my view. If this thing does not immediately plummet next week, bears are going to be shitting the bed.\n3. In addition to the looming MAGA volume and the potential for upside down shorts, there will be massive FOMO from retail if we start to get a move to the upside. Traders that lost money on the initial run up or missed it entirely will stumbling over each other to get back in.\n4. The stock is up like 100% in a week and has essentially just spent the last few days consolidating sideways ABOVE the local high of $58.72 from the previous spike in January. From a purely technical perspective, this doesn't really look like a one and done rally that is just going to dump infinitely from here. Dare I say the chart might even look a bit bullish?\n5. FED was dovish last meeting. GDP print was strong yesterday. Rates have been gently coming down this week. Inflation ticking up a bit recently but not enough for anyone to actually take it seriously yet. Not that this is a macro-play at all, but I do think positive sentiment around the macro environment is a prerequisite for a move like this to take place.\n6. **Easter Fucking Weekend.** What better way to spread the DJT word than some familial chit chat over a lovely Easter Sunday meal. Devouring turkey and deviled eggs, celebrating the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, and a wee bit of hot stock gossip. I can already hear my Granny now, \"Should I buy me some of that Donald Trump stock?\" Yes, Granny. Yes, you should.\n\nMY POSITIONS (will likely be adding Monday morning if all goes accordingly):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3bqrpkag9rc1.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=d70f60e6c8a00310108c16712dbb10200557c38e\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not investment advice. Do your own DD. No offense intended to any of the parties referenced in this post. I have much love and respect for everyone. Especially my Granny.\n\nUPDATE 03/29/24: All-In Podcast discusses DJT at length [(link to clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1001s). Chamath compares DJT to \"Bowie Bonds\" where people will be using it as a vehicle to invest in Trump's brand which will have a significantly different value placed on it than the revenues of a shitty social media company. David believes that many Trump supporters will buy the stock as a \"protest vote\". Lot of eyes on this podcast and they discuss the topic in a very serious manner. Honestly, think this is more than enough to fuel a gap up on Monday morning. Good luck to all.\n\nUPDATE 03/30/24: I am also long \\~500k of the DJT crypto token [(link to token)](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0x32a6047bded36b985534750a4292a35d5dbd4e5f?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults) which has seen a fair amount of buying throughout the weekend. Makes me hopeful that more and more attention is being allocated toward the \"Long Trump\" play. Excited for trading on the DJT stock to get going again. If we are gapping up on Monday morning, I will probably look to buy more calls for 4/5. If we are gapping down, will see how it holds up in the morning and assess from there. Good luck everyone.\n\nUPDATE 03/31/24: Happy Easter to everyone who celebrates it. My granny did not mention the DJT stock nor did any of my relatives. We are currently gapping down on RH, but not necessarily to levels that I would consider the play to be over. Not gonna lie... it's not looking great for my thesis, but I think we still have a chance. See you guys bright and early tomorrow. Good luck folks.\n\nUPDATE 04/01/24: This is not an April Fools joke. It appears that I was utterly wrong on this DD. We are currently down \\~25% on the day which is essentially the exact opposite of what I was anticipating. GG to the bears. I hope you are taking profits though because this still seems an incredible risky stock to be short. I threw some chump change at a few calls on the morning dip. Just going to ride them all out to expiry since they are essentially worthless already anyway. Probably not gonna post anymore updates unless this starts ripping people's faces off. Fingers crossed.

Since the markets are closed, decided to do some DD and dug into the company's SEC filings/prospectus.  \n\nBottom line:  buyer beware... at a $25 price, the company's $50 million portfolio needs to 5x for you to get to net asset value (fundamental-wise).  In this market though, I wouldn't be surprised if this thing rips (see DJT), so make your own decisions!  This is not financial advice.  I am a regard.\n\nDetails:\n\n* It's a closed-end fund with assets of around $50M.  10.88M shareholders.  So net asset value per share is $4.60 per share.  Tuesday's listing was **not** an IPO where the $8.25 original price went to the company itself.  That money went to the person selling the shares (Prasad).\n* It originally acquired its assets at a $75M cost, and the FMV of its assets is now about $50M.\n* Annual management fee expenses of 2.5% of gross assets per year that goes to the founder's (Sohail Prasad) investment advisory LLC.  So $1.25 million out the door every year.\n* Legal, audit, professionals etc. expenses of 2.5% this year.  Another $1.25 million out the door.\n* The company has some cool names in its portfolio (SpaceX, Discord, OpenAI, etc.).  SpaceX makes up around $15M of its $50M porftolio.  Epic Games is $3M.  Discord is $0.3M.  OpenAI is $0.8M or something.\n* So some of its investments could do incredible, but who knows which ones and when.  Let's say OpenAI is a 100 bagger that nets $80 million for the company.  That would mean a portfolio value of $130 million.  NAV would still be around $12 per share.  And if you bought at $25... well, still not great.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "text": "Hello regards! Another regard doing yet another DD on Tesla. \n\nFirst off obviously Tesla has seen quite a fall from grace once touted as one of the magnificent seven it is one of the worst performing S&P stocks this year with losses of 30%. Despite this I believe Tesla is positioned to make a very strong come back and become a multi trillion dollar company in the near future. \n\nFirst of all, despite what other regards say, Tesla makes a majority of its revenue on car sales. With that in mind EV sales still only account for about 9% of new car sales in the US. Meaning the market for EV sales is still relatively nascent and I believe that 2024 will be a watershed year for EVs. Part of the reason why Tesla's share price has shut the bed is because their margins have continued to decline. This is in part due to inflation and also a price war with primarily BYD in China. However, recently the price of lithium has plummeted and we are now seeing this price swing begin to make it's way into the margins of battery prices. Recently BYD and CATL [announced](https://cleantechnica.com/2024/02/26/catl-byd-to-slash-battery-prices-by-50-in-2024-boom-evs-win/) that they will be cutting the costs of their Iron Phosphate battiers by 50% making them around 56 $/kWh well below the DOE's threshold to make EVs cost competitive with ICE cars before incentives. Although we can't say Tesla will be able to do the same I imagine this price decrease is in part due to the rapid decline in lithium prices. In the near term we can expect Tesla to increase its margins and in the mid term we can expect them to further reduce EV prices to stimulate demand. Either way the death of ICE vehicles is just beginning and Tesla has 91% of untapped US market share. \n\nSecondly, despite what Reddit has you believe Cybertruck demand is strong. Elon reported to shareholders that there is a year long backlog of Cybertruck orders and he expects production to ramp in 2024. No one knows what Cybertrucks margins will be but we can expect them to be better than other models due to experience but also due to the fact that the Cybertruck uses 48v and will have significantly less copper than standard 12v cars. \n\nFinally I know there have been a lot of empty FSD promises but version 12 of FSD truly is different and is a step change in progress toward realizing the next level of autonomy. For those of you that don't know version 12 for the first time utilizes AI from end to end. From image recognition to control and there is very clearly an observable difference which is why FSD version 12 beta is now free for one month. On top of this we can only expect FSD to rapidly improve now that the Tesla Dojo is operational. For those of you that don't know Tesla has created their own 7nm GPU with the help of poached AMD engineers. This Dojo computer will be one of the most powerful in the world by June and will be primarily focused on training Tesla's FSD. In the near term I think there is opportunity to surprise investors with a renewed interest in FSD. In the long term it looks as though Tesla will be positioned to make significant advancements on FSD and perhaps spinoff portions of the Dojo as a cloud computing service. \n\nTLDR: Tesla's price represents a period of EV weakness. Battery prices will fall significantly in 2024 making EVs cost competitive. Cyber truck production will ramp and FSD interest will grow with capability ",

July $1p are in play. \n\nThe above link is my last DD on Polestar - a $3bn company. I thought they were going to have an awesome earnings report. After my DD, they went from $1.30 to $2.05ish, and are now trading at $1.60. Since then, a lot of red flags made me change my mind about their goodness:\n\n1: they got $1bn in funding at the end of February(read: debt). This keeps them solvent a little longer\n2: Polestar needs to submit audited financial statements this year, and it’s the first year this is in effect. ALL of their previous annual results were unaudited due to being a foreign Company. 🚩 \n- the same day they released news on their funding, they also announced that they would be delaying financial reporting for FY23 (originally scheduled for Mid-March). 🚩 \n- they still haven’t put out a date for their FY23 results. Further, there’s no projected date for their Q1 results. 🚩 \n\nSo here’s the tinfoil hat: I BELIEVE that their new CFO took one look at the financials, and went “NOPE.” Their financial team is in a spot where they have to verify all the numbers, and I bet they have a lot less cash on hand than we’ve been led to believe (and than they’ve told investors).\n\nThe delay in reporting financials is a HUGE RED FLAG.🚩 \n\nYeah, they got an extra $1bn of funding (which they estimated $1.3bn would keep them afloat through 2024). But if their actual cash position has been overstated, that line of credit gets pulled REALLY quick.\n\nAn event like this would be similar to what happened recently to a different company (let’s call them Fister) - they got funding, but still shut down their production line and have since been de-listed.\n\nSure, Polestar still makes quality cars, but that doesn’t mean they’re not also going broke.\n\nEdit: PSNY files a form 20F (foreign issuer) - this is due within 6 months of the end of the FY - so 30 June is the due date for FY23 reporting.\n\nPositions: 1700 July $1p, purchased today.

        "text": "⚠️ **WARNING:** Currently (Mar 28, 15:00 EST), this is just crazy autistic randomness I've researched.  \nHowever, if you start hearing about Serbia in the news over the weekend or around April 18, come back to read this.\n\n\\-----\n\nYesterday (Mar 27, 2024), the Political Affairs Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) [adopted a recommendation](https://x.com/PACE_News/status/1773013879242506521?s=20) to invite Kosovo to join the organization despite Serbia's strong opposition to the move.\n\nBasically, Serbia has fought against international recognition of Kosovo and its membership in international bodies since Kosovo unilaterally declared independence in 2008, following a war over the territory.\n\nMost of the 46 Council of Europe members have recognized Kosovo as a country.  \nIn fact, Kosovo has its own flag emoji: 🇽🇰\n\nHowever, Serbia still regards Kosovo as part of its territory and has relied on China and Russia to challenge its sovereignty.\n\nIn an [interview](https://www.danas.rs/vesti/politika/uvek-smo-imali-slobodarski-stav-vucic-najavio-mogucnosti-da-srbija-izadje-iz-saveta-evrope/) with local broadcaster Prva TV, Serbian President [Aleksandar Vučić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vučić) mentioned that accepting Kosovo’s bid to join the organization “would de-facto mean kicking out Serbia.”\n\nIn response, Viola von Cramon-Taubadel--a German member of the European Parliament--considers Serbia's threat to be a [bluff](https://x.com/ViolavonCramon/status/1771426486400188901?s=20). And it might be.\n\nHowever, Ana Brnabic--Serbian's Prime Minister--[fired back](https://x.com/anabrnabic/status/1771520607995236423?s=20).\n\n>As for Serbia, dear... - we do not bluff. If the Council of Europe breaches its Statute and its values - truly no need to be part of that hypocrisy and charade. 👋👋\n\n\\-----\n\nAs I said before, this Balkan drama might lead to a nothing-burger.  \nHowever, Kosovo's membership in the Council of Europe would [allow its citizens to sue Serbia for war crimes in the European Court of Human Rights](https://x.com/kos_data/status/1773382297850454299?s=20).\n\nFurthermore, this is a [recent post](https://x.com/albinkurti/status/1770943735657800031?s=20) by the official account from the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kosova:\n\n>Days ago, Serbia's president issued an open threat: They are waiting for the best possible opportunity to invade 🇽🇰. Today, Serbian Army units have been detected just meters away from our border. We are closely monitoring the situation for any attempt to cross into 🇽🇰 territory.\n\nGranted, the drone video from the border does not seem like an imminent invasion, but it shows this event is raising the temperature between both sides.\n\nI researched the [Kosovo subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kosovo/rising/), but this doesn't seem to be on their radar.\n\nHowever, Serbian President [Aleksandar Vučić](https://twitter.com/avucic) recently issued a grim statement about an unspecified threat to his country, [raising alarm bells](https://www.thedailybeast.com/serbian-presidents-alarming-social-media-warning-stirs-mystery-in-europe) about a possible geopolitical conflict.\n\n>Difficult days are ahead of Serbia. At this moment, it is not easy to say what kind of news we have received in the last 48 hours, \\[but\\] they directly threaten our vital national interests, both of Serbia and \\[Republika\\] Srpska \\[referring to the ethnically Serb Republika Srpska\\].  \n>  \n>In the coming days, I will introduce the people of Serbia to all the challenges that lie ahead. It will be difficult. We will fight. Serbia will win.\n\nWhile digging deeper, I found out the [White House had already noticed a large Serbian force along the Kosovo border](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-monitoring-large-serbian-force-along-kosovo-border-white-house-2023-09-29/). Also, some experts have claimed that Russia would benefit--and thus promote--a new conflict in Europe.\n\n\\-----\n\nPersonally, I bought some **VIX** calls, not just in case this news evolves over the long weekend but also because I'm gambling several hedge funds will offload positions into the new quarter.\n\nAs for this particular DD, there's no Kosovo or Serbia ETF.  \nThe only one I could find with some exposure is LEMB. That's the [iShares J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239528/ishares-emerging-markets-local-currency-bond-etf), which focuses on local currency-denominated government bonds issued by emerging market countries. However, Serbia only represents 4.47%.\n\nI found no obvious, recognizable Kosovo-based or Serbia-based companies listed in the U.S. market.\n\nAccording to the [U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-serbia), \"U.S. firms have invested around $4 billion in Serbia and employ more than 20,000 workers there.  Among the leading U.S. investors in the country are NCR, Philip Morris, Molson Coors, Ball Packaging, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Cooper Tire, Ametek, and Van Drunen Farms.\"\n\nI found no crucial export from either Kosovo or Serbia. I mean, nothing that truly stands out.\n\nThe only play I'm targeting (aside from my VIX gamble) is **ENLT**.\n\nWhy?  \nJust yesterday:\n\n>[Enlight Renewable Energy](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/27/2853039/0/en/EBRD-and-Erste-Approve-Financing-for-the-Pupin-Windfarm-in-Serbia.html) Ltd. closed on the financing of the Pupin wind farm project in Serbia\n\nAnd there's another wrinkle.  \nOn Oct 2, 2023, ENLT announced they had secured PPA for the Pupin wind farm in Serbia.\n\n>Under the PPA, the state-owned utility Elektroprivreda Srbije will purchase 72% of the project's output at a price of EUR 69 per MWh linked to Eurostat's Consumer Price Index.  \nThe remainder of the electricity produced will be sold on a merchant basis.  \n>  \n>With a total generation capacity of 94 megawatts, the Pupin project will cost USD$149-157 million, and is expected to generate revenues of USD$22-24 million and EBITDA of USD$13-15 million in its first full year of operation.  \n>  \n>Enlight has recently signed a binding agreement to acquire a 66% stake in the project from its partners, which is subject to approval by the Serbian regulator.  \n>  \n>The Company will own 100% of the project after completion of the acquisition.  \n>  \n>Pupin is expected to reach commercial operation in the second half of 2025.\n\nNow, ENLT announced this as positive (bullish) news, yet look at what happened to their stock after that day. **She plunged -20% in six days.**\n\nTherefore, I assume this Pupin project is an important catalyst for the company.\n\nSo far, I just bought some puts.  \nIf you decide to gamble along, I would recommend an expiration date beyond April 18 since that's the day when the PACE will vote on Kosovo's membership.\n\n\\-----\n\nOnce more, this is just some random research I've done.  \nI mean, so far, not even the [US Embassy in Serbia](https://twitter.com/USEmbassySerbia) has posted a warning.  \nBut if something happens, I already have my watchlist ready.\n\nHave a great day.",

As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays — short for organic light-emitting diode — while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.\n\nThe move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It’s been about 18 months since the last updates — a drought that’s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/when-is-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-coming-out-apple-plans-early-may-launch?srnd=homepage-americas",

Moreover, the report mentioned enormous $2.2B in undisclosed service liabilities.\n\nBloom Energy immediately denied this and said that they strongly disagree with the research, and the next day, they issued a massive rebuttal to Hindenburg.\n\nThough, BE had already dropped, and Bloom, with its hyped IPO, faced problems with loads of lawsuits, investigations, and so on. They, by the way, decided to [settle this for $3M](https://11thestate.com/cases/be-ipo-settlement) with investors (in my opinion, they just bought their way out). \n\nBut the \"Hindenburg\" vibe is still hanging around, and that report still pops up on the top when you googling Bloom.

Remember when your $1 eggs went to $5? Zoetis has a vaccine for HPAI in chickens, but due to the short lifespan of a chicken and the cost involved with vaccinating 1,000,000 birds in some barns, it was more cost effective to cross your fingers, hope they didn't catch it, and if they did, you did a slightly more sophisticated version of what NVDA put holders did - close the garage doors and keep the engine running.\n\nNot quite so simple or cost effective with a herd of dairy cattle. Those infected already will likely be culled and find their way into your local Wendys patty, but to limit further infection, I expect there will be a rush to vaccinate uninfected cattle. And you don't think they're going to put the cost of vaccination and the cost of mass producing it on our poor dairy farmers and pharmaceutical companies, do you? Here comes the US government to the rescue paying 10x a shot to encourage drug companies to ramp up production and a bunch of farmers who have been triggered by the word \"vaccine\" for 4 years to actually use it.\n\nBut the link says the disease is only in Texas and Kansas you may say. Wait a couple weeks. A lot of dairy heifers are raised in those states due to their favorable weather compared to WI, NY, and other large northern dairy states, so a lot of those heifers are catching it down there and getting shipped to their home herds daily. Idaho closed their borders to cattle last week, but they are the only state to do so thus far.\n\nWhy Zoetis? I work in the dairy industry and have known about this for a couple weeks, so when I saw a tweet from the Nancy Pelosi Stock Tracker that Rep. Shelley Moore bought $50k of Zoetis stock on 3/15, I chose them as my horse in this race. Moore is a ranking member of the Environmental & Public Works Committee. Merck is also rumored to have a vaccine, but ZTS has 1/4 of their market cap where this could have more effect.\n\nTLDR: Cows sick, buy cow drug company.\n\n&#x200B;",

The electric vehicle industry as a whole is becoming more **crowded** than ever before at the absolute **worst time** for the company, just as its fundamentals are coming into question. To date the company's share price has dropped more than **60%** from its 2021 all-time high of $407.\n3. This cramped competition can be realized even further with the fact that China’s electric vehicle champion, BYD, has **overtaken** Tesla as the **largest** EV producer in the world, with a 22% increase in global sales for Q4 of last year, surpassing Tesla by over 41,000 units. This is bad news for Tesla as it begins to lose its **foothold** over the Asian region even further as its ***gap*** over the Chinese rival decreased from 400,000 units posted in 2022 to 230,000 units posted in 2023.\n4. After **missing** expectations on the company's reported earnings earlier this year, it has become apparent that demand for electric vehicles has **declined** and is notably lower than last year. The company seems to be **stuck** between two major growth phases as it works on launching its next-generation vehicles. We can only hope that those new cars don’t have any major issues as the current generation of vehicles does; otherwise, Tesla could spiral into an even deeper rabbit hole than it currently is.\n\nA new [***report***](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibG9vbWJlcmcuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyNC0wMy0xMy90ZXNsYS1hLWdyb3d0aC1jb21wYW55LXdpdGgtbm8tZ3Jvd3RoLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLXNheXM_ZW1iZWRkZWQtY2hlY2tvdXQ9dHJ1ZSZ1dG1fc291cmNlPXd3dy5ibGFja3N3YW5zdHJlZXQuY29tJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXRlc2xhLXR1bWJsZXMtZnVydGhlci13aWxsLWFueXRoaW5nLXN0b3AtaXRzLWZhbGwiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiMzFlYThiMTQtMWQ3ZC00NTY3LTgyOWItYmZhMTFlNDg1NzY0IiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI3ZWY1YzJkNS0xNjJjLTQ3NGUtYWZjNy0zNGFiNzQxNDk1N2QiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImViY2I5NmU3LWU3MjAtNDE1OC05YTYxLTBiZTNmNTU4YWFiNSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMTYzNzk2NCwiaXNzIjoib3JjaGlkIn0.GKIiBfJLQQM0qqAqrdVfXrVAe8GDAicUtRr89tdZMOc) by Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan gives analysts an even darker picture than previously imagined, stating that the company is a “growth company with no growth.” We can only keep watching to see what happens from here on out for Tesla.\n\nTha Full story from [here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)",

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.  \n>  \n>Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company received orders for more than 20,000 cars in seven minutes at its [March 12 pre-order launch](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/xiaomi-is-set-to-launch-its-su7-electric-car-on-march-28.html), he added.  \n>  \n>Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, he said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/xiaomi-releases-electric-car-4k-cheaper-than-teslas-model-3-as-price-wars-heat-up.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/xiaomi-releases-electric-car-4k-cheaper-than-teslas-model-3-as-price-wars-heat-up.html)",

        "text": "**Disclamer: this DD includes leaps.**\n\n**The US oil industry is booming.** Since 2022 the international energy markets have been going crazy. Firstly because of the sanctions on Russian oil, and secondly because of the supply cuts done by Saudis and Russians. To combat the problem of rising oil and gas prices the US has increased its oil production to a record high making it the largest oil producer in the world. This is quite funny considering that the Biden administration has also done more work towards cutting the emissions than anyone before. There is no going back to Russian oil for Europe and the tensions in the Middle East makes US the most important and reliable supplier. Even if Biden gets re-elected, the oil boom will likely continue for the upcoming years because of the geopolitical factors – US is the safest supplier and everyone still needs oil. Now the wild card is if Trump gets re-elected. The political climate will go from saving the planet to a complete climate change denialism and the consequences will lead to a rally like never before. Trumps re-election cannot be priced in until it is certain but the expectations will be very high and thus the premiums will be through the roof. Now my strategy is to buy leaps right now so I will be positioned beforehand. This cannot go south because we are booming already and the pressure of inflation will force Biden to keep it drillin’ in any case. If Trump wins it's only extra.\n\nAnd I know what you are thinking. What’s the point of buying leaps? they are too expensive and I can’t lose my account in a week with them… but they are not. At least this one isn’t. Plains All American, Ticker: PAA, PAGP(holding company).\n\nThe industry is divided into three segments: upstream, midstream and downstream. I know you don’t care about this but the point is that midstream companies are more stable against commodity price fluctuations and they benefit from increased demand. The politics almost guarantee the high demand. Here is the list of the biggest midstream companies:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/r1r1xrkbayqc1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0fe9e0679dbefcf47b173c0a109a0b27031443)\n\nPAA is the 11. largest on the list. I looked through the options on all of these and PAA has dirt cheap premiums. EPD, ET, KMI had also low premiums so I suggest you look through the others too. The PAA stock is doing good, 9/10 positive earnings streak, doing good financially, couple of oil spills to make a reputation, no former employees assassinated etc. The stock has already gone up by about 50% in the past year and is at 17$. I bought jan/25 20$ calls for 20c and jan/26 22$ calls for 25c a piece. The stock has ATH at 61$ and if it goes to 25$ for example that’s already a 25-bagger. Now I know that's a big increase, about 50% in 10 months, but think about pricing in 4 years worth of oil drilling heaven. And If Trump doesn't win, OK, we are still going to go up since the demand just keeps growing. The premiums should really be 10x higher this far out. The upside leverage is just insane.\n\n**My positions:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xkujm6lcayqc1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7f50373da4329223c045078974d184715a0f09)",

        "text": "Below are multiple of Mr. Wallers more important remarks in his speech:\n\n\"In 2023, we made progress on reducing inflation and improving the job market, but recent data has made me unsure about the pace of this progress. February's job gains and inflation measures have been stronger than expected, indicating that we need more time to assess the situation. So, I don't see a need to rush into cutting interest rates just yet.\"\n\n\"Looking at the economic performance, GDP growth is expected to slow this quarter, but it's still solid. Consumer spending is moderating, especially on goods, while services spending is growing moderately. Business surveys show mixed results, with manufacturing activity contracting slightly while nonmanufacturing businesses continue to expand.\"\n\n\"As for the job market, recent data suggests strong job gains, but the unemployment rate rose slightly, mainly due to more young people being counted as unemployed. The number of people quitting their jobs has decreased, indicating less turnover, which means firms aren't competing as much for workers.\"\n\n\"Regarding productivity, recent growth has been fast, but it's uncertain whether it will continue. Factors like large investment projects and resolving supply chain issues may have boosted productivity in the short term, but it's unclear if this will be sustained.\"\n\n\"On inflation, recent data has been disappointing, with both total and core inflation increasing. While there are reasons to believe progress will continue, we need to monitor the situation closely.\"\n\n\"Overall, I believe there's no rush to cut interest rates. The economy is strong, and waiting a little longer to assess the trajectory of inflation is the prudent approach.\"\n\nREAD THE FULL SPEECH HERE: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240327a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240327a.htm)",

Companies like Intel and TSMC buy their equipment to make chip plants\n\nWhy is ASML so interesting? Cause they are making the world’s first 2 nano meter lithography machines (that’s really fucking small and enables next level AI chips and memory). Per the article below they are already sold out to Intel and others and are expanding their capacity\n\nI’ll keep this straightforward: Nvidia and Micron, Intel , etc all need this tech to make more and more powerful AI chips.  \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asml-launch-high-na-lithography-machine-2nm-chip-manufacturing-i9dac?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&utm_campaign=share_via\n\nRisks: this 2 na tech is brand new and very cutting edge.  There maybe delays as it gets production ramped up as TSM and others evaluate and work through kinks\n\nNow let’s look at the stock:\n\nIt’s at all time highs and isn’t cheap with a PE of 44 (vs 75 for NVDIA).  Note it actually have a dividend yield at .68%. So the metrics are a little expensive but not really stretched.  I expect their next earnings call (April 17) to be a huge catalyst as  2na adoption is discussed\n\nTLDR:\nThese guys have the shit every chip mfg is going to have to have to compete for the most advanced AI processors and memory.   This is a “shovels and mortar” play for AI and will be a slower stock rise than others but should see another 50% in the next year as people see 2na chip machines get bought.  Near term catalyst is April 17 earnings call. \n\nNote: there are real risks with chip tech this advanced. I wouldn’t YOLO it but if you want to be more risky i would do some slightly out of the money option plays if your due diligence agrees with mine around April 17. Personally i am doing stock for now.  \n\n",

        "text": " “It’s the talk of the stock market: What will be the sign that the five-month rally in US equities is coming to an end. But if you ask JPMorgan Chase Co.’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, investors may not see it coming when it hits.\n\nThe Wall Street giant’s chief global equity strategist warned clients on Wednesday that they could be “stuck on the wrong side” of the momentum trade when it eventually falters, and he encouraged them to consider diversifying their holdings and thinking about risk management in their portfolios. He also reiterated his warning that excessive crowding in the market’s best-performing stocks raises the risk of an imminent correction.\n\n“It just might come one day out of the blue. This has happened in the past, we’ve had flash crashes,” Lakos-Bujos said in a webinar. “One big fund starts de-levering some positions, a second fund hears that and tries to re-position, the third fund basically gets caught off guard, and the next thing you know, we start having a bigger and bigger momentum unwind.”\n\nHis remarks come in the final trading days of a strong first quarter for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index on track for a roughly 10% return. The broad US equities benchmark will post its fifth consecutive month of gains as corporate earnings remain strong, enthusiasm around artificial intelligence keeps building, the US economy continues to be healthy and the Federal Reserve signals its willingness to cut interest rates this year \n\nBut to Lakos-Bujas, that list actually is a reason for concern. \n\n“A lot of goodies have gotten priced in,” he said, from earnings and Fed expectations, to even a potential election victory for former president Donald Trump, which he said would be viewed as helpful for the market. Moreover, he sees few sources of upside surprise beyond Nvidia Corp. and the prospects for AI innovation. “That source of upside surprise is becoming more and more limited, and on the flipside, you do have more risks that are hovering in the background,” he said.\n\nMoreover, looking at recent history, the rush into popular momentum stocks like the Magnificent Seven typically is followed by a correction. It’s happened three times since the Global Financial Crisis.\n\n“Historically, whenever you had such a high degree of crowding it was a question of weeks before the momentum factor faced a big fat left tail unwind,” Lakos-Bujas said, pointing to Tesla Inc.’s 27% plunge and Apple Inc.’s 10% drop this year after strong 2023s as examples of what’s to come.\n\n“Who is going to be the next one — and when?” he said.\n\nLakos-Bujas and other strategists at JPMorgan, including Marko Kolanovic, have been among few bearish contrarians on Wall Street this year. As most of their peers raise their US equity outlooks, with the stock market continually setting new highs, they have remained pessimistic that the gains would stick. Among the big Wall Street banks, the firm holds the lowest year-end target on the S&P 500 of 4,200, implying a drop of nearly 20% from Wednesday’s level.\n\nThe bank’s house view on US equities has failed to materialize for two consecutive years as Lakos-Bujas and Kolanovic remained bullish throughout most of 2022’s rout and then held a bearish stance during last year’s 24% rally in the S&P 500.”",
