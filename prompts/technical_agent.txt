From week {week}, some recent basic stock factors are presented below:
Alpha: MV7 - Moving Average of 7 Days
Formula: ts_mean(close, 7)
Explanation: This Formula expression calculates the average closing price over the past 7 days, which helps to smooth out short-term volatility and identify the underlying trend in the price movement. Historical Values: 7798,7848,7878
Historical Values: {mv7}
Alpha: MV20 - Moving Average of 20 Days
Formula: ts_mean(close, 20)
Explanation: Similar to MV7, this Formula expression computes the average closing price over a longer period of 20 days. This is often used to assess the medium-term market trend and
can act as support or resistance levels for the price.
Historical Values: {mv20}
Alpha: MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence
Formula: minus(ewma(close, 12), ewma(close, 26))
Explanation: The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The Formula expression represents the difference between the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) and the 26-day EMA of the closing prices.
Historical Values: {macd}
Alpha: EMA - Exponential Moving Average
Formula: ewma(close, com=0.5)
Explanation: This Formula expression calculates the exponential moving average of the closing prices, giving more weight to recent prices. The com parameter controls the degree of weighting decrease, making it a more sensitive measure of recent price movements.
Historical Values: {ema}
Alpha: Bollinger Bands - Middle Line
Formula: ts_stddev(close, 20)
Explanation: This Formula expression is the simple moving average of the closing price over the past 20 days. It serves as the middle line in Bollinger Bands and is used to determine the intermediate-term trend. Historical Values: 202,206,202
Historical Values: {bbmid}
Alpha: Bollinger Bands - Upper Band
Formula: plus(ts_mean(close, 20), times(ts_stddev(close, 20), 2))
Explanation: The upper band of the Bollinger Bands is calculated by adding two standard deviations to the 20-day moving average. This band adjusts for volatility and can signal overbought conditions when the price touches or breaches the upper band.
Historical Values: {bbup}
Alpha: Bollinger Bands - Lower Band
Formula: minus(ts_mean(close, 20), times(ts_stddev(close, 20), 2))
Explanation: The lower band of the Bollinger Bands is calculated by subtracting two standard deviations from the 20-day moving average. It also adjusts for volatility and can signal oversold conditions when the price touches or breaches the lower band.
Historical Values: {bblow}
Alpha: LogMomentum
Formula: log(minus(close, shift(close, 1)))
Explanation: This Formula expression calculates the natural logarithm of the difference between the current closing price and the previous day’s closing price. It provides a measure of the momentum of the security’s price by capturing the rate of change on a logarithmic scale.
Historical Values: {logmom}
Alpha: VMA60 - Volume Moving Average 60
Formula: data[’Volume’].rolling(60).mean() / (data[’Volume’] + 1e-12)
Explanation: The VMA60 Formula expression calculates the average volume over a 60-day period and divides it by the current volume plus a small constant to prevent division by zero. It compares the current volume to the average volume over a longer period, which can signal changes in trader participation. Historical Values: 113,131,129
Historical Values: {vma60}
