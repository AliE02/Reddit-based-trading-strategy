    "## Sentiment Analysis Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Simple Method: LSTM Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "Using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model** for sentiment analysis is a well-established approach. LSTM is a specialized type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) known for its ability to learn long-term dependencies, making it an excellent choice for sequence prediction problems such as text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation Details\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Steps:** \n",
    "  - To prepare our reddit financial data for the LSTM model, we will standardize the text. This involves:\n",
    "    - Removing special characters and numbers.\n",
    "    - Converting all text to lowercase.\n",
    "    - Tokenizing the text into words.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Model Configuration:**\n",
    "  - Our LSTM model will be configured with:\n",
    "    - Multiple layers to capture different levels of textual context.\n",
    "    - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    - A final dense layer with a softmax activation to classify sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Outcome\n",
    "By employing an LSTM model, we aim to achieve robust performance in detecting sentiments within reddit's financial discussions, accounting for the nuances and complexities of financial terminology and expressions."
